Abstract: We propose that relative economic backwardness contributes to the build-up of social tension and the incidence of both nonviolent and violent forms of opposition to the current political regime.  We take inspiration from Gerschenkron's (1962) essay on economic backwardness and more recent findings on international comparisons and status-seeking to develop a testable hypothesis. We use information on a large number of countries and years from a new dataset on episodes of organized mass movements and find that greater economic backwardness is indeed consistently linked to a higher probability of seeing both violent and nonviolent forms of civil unrest.  IV estimations using three different instruments, including distance to either London or Washington, D.C., and mailing speeds and telegram charges around 1900, suggest that this relationship is causal.

Abstract: The disposition effect describes the tendency of investors to sell assets that have increased in value since purchase, and hold those that have not.  We analyse the introduction of betting market `Cash-Outs', which provide a continual update - and therefore increase the salience - of bettors' paper profits/losses on each bet.  We find that the introduction of Cash-Out exacerbated an already large disposition effect in this market, as punters sold their profitable bets with even greater frequency than before.  We do not, however, find that the disposition effect has any impact on asset prices, either before or after this intervention.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that the fastest algorithmic traders in financial markets profit at the expense of slower traders.  One solution gaining traction is a `speed-bump', which introduces a delay between the time in which an order is submitted, and when it is processed.  We conduct an impact evaluation of the speed bump's effectiveness on Betfair, a betting exchange, where this design has been in force for more than a decade.  We find that increases in the duration of the delay led to improvements in liquidity (measured by bid-ask spreads and depth) and market quality (measured by order frequency and volume).

Abstract: We analyze a group all-pay auction with a group specific public good prize in which one group follows a weakest-link and the other group follows a best-shot impact function. This type of game depicts situations in which the best-shot group is an attacker and the other group is a defender. We show that when the per-capita valuations are equal across groups, there exists a continuum of mixed strategy equilibria in which both groups randomize continuously without a gap over the same interval whose lower bound is zero. There are two further types of equilibria with discontinuous strategies. For the first type, each player in the best-shot group puts mass at the upper bound of the support whereas each player in the other group puts mass at the lower bound of the support. For the second type, players in the best-shot group put masses at both the lower and the upper bounds, while the other group randomizes without an atom. If players in the best-shot group could coordinate on the mass they put at the upper bound of the support, they would want to make it as large as possible (within the relevant range).

Abstract: Does speculative trade reduce mispricing - and help create efficient markets - or drive prices further from fundamentals?  We analyse betting exchange trading, on 9,562 U.K. horse races in 2013 and 2014, to find out.  Crucially, as each race is run, the fundamental value of bets is unambiguously revealed.  We find that the direction and volume of market order trade is predictive of fundamentals, suggesting that speculative trade is, on average, conducive to market efficiency.  However, much of this effect is concentrated in the in-running period (during races) - when, even without trade, asset fundamentals would be revealed seconds later.

Abstract: It is observed in neuroscience, economics and psychology experiments that the presence of an image of a pair of eyes may result in higher level of altruistic behavior by subjects. It is hence concluded that the eye-image serves as a `social Êcue'. We test this against an alternative hypothesis that the higher level of altruism may occur since the eye-image triggers an experimenter demand effect in the same direction with the perceived altruism. We run a `Taking game' with and without eye-image in which the recipient owns some money, and the dictator can take any amount from that. In such a case the social cue and the experimenter demand effect go in opposite directions. We find no overall difference in the amount taken in those treatments. However, males take significantly less and females take insignificantly more under the treatment with eye-image. We conclude that the presence of eyes may have both the social cue and the experimental demand effects, and the net effect depends on the relative magnitude and the direction of the two. For males, the social cue effect is more prominent.

Abstract: Betting exchanges allow punters to bet on a horse to lose a race.  This, many argue, has opened up the sport to a new form of corruption, where races will be deliberately lost in order to profit from betting.  We examine whether anecdotal evidence of the fixing of horses to lose - of which there are many examples - is indicative of wider corruption.  We build an asymmetric information model of exchange betting, and take it to betting data on 9,560 races run in 2013/14.  We find no evidence of the widespread corruption of horse racing by the betting exchanges.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new estimation strategy that uses the variation in success between the male and the female national soccer team within a country to identify the causal impact of gender equality on women's soccer performance. In particular, we analyze whether within-country variations in labor force participation rates and life expectancies between the genders, which serve as measures for the countryÕs gender equality, are able to explain differences in the international success of male and female national soccer teams. Our results reveal that differences in male and female labor force participation rates and life expectancies are able to explain the international soccer performance of female teams, but not that of male teams, suggesting that gender equality is an important driver of female sport success.

Abstract: This paper estimates effects of exposure to compulsory voting on individuals' political preferences, through a regression discontinuity framework. These results are important to understand effects of a voting system transition. The identification comes from Brazil's dual voting system: voluntary and compulsory. Using self-collected data, we find that compulsory voting legislation has sizeable effects on individuals' political preferences, making them more likely to identify with a political party, to become extreme oriented and to move to the left.

Abstract: We analyze symmetric, two-bidder all-pay auctions with interdependent valuations and discrete
type spaces. Relaxing previous restrictions on the distribution of types and the valuation structure,
we present a construction that computes all symmetric equilibria. We show how the search problem
this construction faces can be complex. In equilibrium, randomization can take place over
disjoint ranges of bids, equilibrium supports can have a rich structure, and non-monotonicity of
the equilibrium may result in a positive probability of allocative inefficiency when the value of the
prize is not common. Particular attention is paid to the case in which an increase in a bidder's
posterior expected value for winning the auction is likely to be accompanied by a corresponding
increase for the other bidder. Such environments are `highly competitive' in the sense that the
bidder's higher valuation also signals that the other bidder has an incentive to bid aggressively.

Abstract: Contests are ubiquitous in economic and political settings. Contest designers often use tools
to make a contest among asymmetric contestants more even, in order to either elicit higher
effort levels, or for ethical reasons. Handicapping - in which stronger participants are a priori
weakened - is one successful tool that is widely used in sports, promotional tournaments and
procurement auctions. In this study we show theoretically that participants may also increase
their destructive effort, and sabotage their rivals' performance, when handicapping is employed.
We empirically verify this prediction using data on 19,635 U.K. horse-races in 2011 and 2012.
Our results suggest that while a level field may be conducive to heightened positive effort in
general, in a setting where both handicapping and sabotage (`interference') are present it also
lays the ground for greater destruction.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of the availability of resources that can be expended in conflict on conflict intensity. 
We run a between-subjects Tullock contest in which we vary the contest budget from Low to Medium to High, while keeping the Nash equilibrium bid the same. 
We find an `inverted U-shaped' relationship between resource availability and conflict intensity. While standard error correction models can explain the first part of the relationship by attributing resources as constraint, they do not apply in the latter part. 
We further run a Wealth treatment in which the budget remains Medium, but a fixed payment independent of the contest outcome is provided. 
The level of conflict in the Wealth and the High treatment are not different, implying a wealth effect through available resources. 
We conclude that the resources for conflict can have both a constraint as well as a wealth effect. 
When initial resources are scarce, they act as a constraint. As more resources become available the constraint loosens up and conflict intensity increases. 
However, when resources are abundant, they are viewed as wealth and conflict intensity decreases. 
Hence, the availability of additional resources reduces the marginal benefit from winning as well as conflict intensity.

Abstract: Appointing public officials is an important feature of modern democracies. Citizens are
periodically asked to select amongst different candidates whom they want to appoint as
public officials in central or local governments. There may be a trade-off on the extent to
which candidates are seen as competent versus the extent to which they are seen as
trustworthy. In our experiment, we ask voters to select a public official, on the competence
and trustworthiness of which their final payoffs depend. We measure the competence of
candidates in a real effort task and their trustworthiness in a trust game, and provide this
information to voters when they make their voting decision. By looking at cases where there
is a competence-trustworthiness trade-off, we can then measure the extent to which
competence and trustworthiness matter in electoral decisions. We find that, in general, most
voters tend to select the candidate rationally, based on who provides the highest expected
profit irrespectively of trustworthiness and competence, but there is a bias towards caring
about trustworthiness when the difference in expected profits between the two candidates is
small enough.

Title: On the Optimal Social Contract: Agency Costs of Self-Government
Author-Name: Sang-Hyun Kim

Author-Workplace-Name: University of East Anglia
Abstract: In a typical study of political economy, citizens are regarded as principals, and government
as agent. This is a modern way of thinking in the sense that classical theorists
of democracy such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and James Madison were more interested in
the dual nature of people; they are principals (citizens sharing the sovereign power) and,
at the same time, agents (subjects under the laws). Government, in their framework, is
an intermediate body which helps people solve their self-control problem. Equipped with
tools of modern economics, this paper explores the classical problem to see how economic
development and political institutionalization relate to the structure of government and the
quality of public sector. In particular, I consider repeated games with a large population
and incomplete information, in which players decide whether to sacrifice private consumption
to provide public goods. Because both people and the executive of public projects
are subject to moral hazard, the people spend resources to monitor the executive and the
people themselves. The optimal self-enforcing contract, which can be interpreted as an
efficiency upper bound of political systems, is characterized. The analysis of the contract
shows that as a country gets more economically developed and politically institutionalized,
the agency problem on the people's side becomes negligible, and the citizens' demand
for accountable government becomes stronger, in which case the standard principal-agent
framework is good enough to describe the political reality.

Abstract: We consider a multi-winner nested elimination contest in which losers are sequentially eliminated to attain the set of winners. This is a variant of a widely used
mechanism introduced by Clark and Riis (1996) that allows one to select the winners
sequentially. We show that the nested elimination mechanism becomes equivalent to
another popular mechanism suggested by Berry (1993) where the winners are chosen
simultaneously.

Abstract: We analyze private and social incentives for standardization to ensure market-wide
system compatibility in a two-dimensional spatial competition model. It is shown that
there is a fundamental conflict of interest between consumers and producers over the
standardization decision. Consumers prefer standardization with full compatibility because
it offers more variety that confers better match with their ideal specifications.
However, firms are likely to choose the minimum compatibility to maximize product
differentiation and soften competition. This is in sharp contrast to the previous literature
that shows the alignment of private and social incentives for compatibility. We
also characterize the free-entry equilibria under the maximum and the minimum compatibility.
With free entry, more firms enter without standardization, but the number
of available system variety is less than the one under standardization.

Abstract: We propose a Bayesian framework for nowcasting GDP growth in real
time. Using vintage data on macroeconomic announcements we set up
a state space system connecting latent GDP growth rates to agencies'
releases of GDP and other economic indicators. We propose a Gibbs
sampling scheme to filter out daily GDP growth rates using all available
macroeconomic information. The sample draws from the resulting posterior distri#bution, thereby allowing us to simulate backcasting, nowcasting,
and forecasting densities. A stochastic search variable selection procedure
yields a data-driven way of selecting the relevant GDP predictors out of a
potentially large set of economic indicators.

Abstract: A stationary bilinear (SB) model can be used to describe processes
with a time-varying degree of persistence that depends on past shocks. An
example of such a process is inflation. This study develops methods for
Bayesian inference, model comparison, and forecasting in the SB model.
Using monthly U.K. inflation data, we find that the SB model outperforms
the random walk and first order autoregressive AR(1) models in terms of
root mean squared forecast errors for both the one-step-ahead and the
multi-step-ahead out-of-sample forecast. In addition, the SB model is superior
to these two models in terms of predictive likelihood for 208 out
of 243 forecast observations. In particular, compared with a lower order
autoregressive AR model, the SB model is much better at predicting the
inflation observations during the financial crisis and immediately after.

Abstract: Asset prices tend to cluster at round numbers. We examine betting exchange data on U.K. horse races to establish whether limited cognition is partially responsible for this clustering. The key tool in this study is the stark increase in cognitive load faced by traders during races compared to prior to races. Using an approach that is part regression discontinuity and part difference-in-difference, we find that traders exhibit a substantially higher propensity to quote round numbers during races. This result is robust to a series of placebo tests, and also to the use of bounds to deal with missing data.

Abstract: People who belong to the same group often behave alike. 
	Is this because people with similar preferences naturally associate with each other or because group
	dynamics cause individual preferences and/or the information that they have
	to converge? This is the question that we address with a natural experiment.
	We focus on the possible influence of peers on two types of individual political
	behaviour: political identification on a left-right spectrum and political engagement. 
	We find no evidence that peer political identification affects individual
	identification. But we do find that peer engagement affects individual engagement, 
	individual political knowledge and political identification among those who
	are initially least engaged. We argue this (and other evidence) is most likely to
	arise from peer effects on the information that individuals have and not their
	preferences.

Abstract: Agents with a richer set of opportunities to trade should be able to demand better terms of trade.
For instance, workers who are otherwise equally-qualified may differ in their access to vacancies,
e.g. because their social networks are larger or smaller. We present a model of search and matching
in which multiple workers may be matched to the same vacancy, and workers compete directly in
the wage bargining process. Workers with greater access have a higher dynamic outside option
and demand higher wages. They are therefore unsuccessful candidates in some matches; this
latter outcome is not possible in existing models based on Nash bargaining to determine wages.
In particular, when markets are tight and the expected length of a position is short, workers with
better access to opportunities will remain unemployed longer than those with less access.

Abstract: A contest is a situation in which individuals expend resources in
order to win valuable prize(s). `Sabotage' is a deliberate, and often
costly and illegal, act of damaging a rival's likelihood of winning the
contest. It is done by exerting resources to negatively influence the effectiveness of a rival's efforts, or by increasing the rival's cost of effort,
or by denying the rival access to resources. Sabotage can be observed
in sports, war, promotional tournaments, political or marketing cam-
paigns etc. In this article, we review the economics literature analyzing
the act of sabotage in contests. We introduce a general structure and
discuss the theories and evidence highlighting why sabotage occurs,
the effects of sabotage on individual players and on overall welfare,
and possible mechanisms to reduce the act of sabotage. We conclude
by pointing out certain areas of future research.

Abstract: We investigate a group all-pay auction with weakest-link impact function
and group-specific public good prize. Since only the minimum effort exerted
among all group members represents the group effort and the group with the maximum
group effort wins the contest, this is termed as the `Max-Min group contest'.
Examples of such structure include various sporting events, territorial conicts, negative product or political campaigns etc. We fully characterize equilibria for
the case of two groups and show that a continuum of pure strategy equilibria
exist, in which all (active) players exert the same effort. A semi-pure strategy
equilibrium may also exist in which all the members of one group play the same
pure strategy whereas all the members of the other group play the same mixed
strategy. There are two types of non-degenerate mixed strategy equilibria - with
and without continuous supports. When either type of such equilibrium exists, it
exhibits the same support and effort distribution of group members. We also fully
characterize pure strategy equilibria for a general case of n groups and specify
candidates for mixed strategy equilibria.

Abstract: This study analyzes a group contest in which one group (defenders) follows a weakest link
whereas the other group (attackers) follows a best-shot impact function. We fully
characterize the equilibria and show that with symmetric valuation the equilibrium is unique up
to the permutation of the identity of the active player in the attacker group. With asymmetric
valuation it is always an equilibrium for one of the highest valuation players to be active; it may
also be the case that the highest valuation players in group 1 free-ride completely on a player
with a lower valuation. However, in any equilibrium, only one player in the attacker group is
active, whereas all the players in the defender group are active and exert the same effort. We also
characterize equilibria for the case in which one group follows either a best-shot or a weakestlink
but the other group follows a perfectly substitute impact function.

Abstract: This paper examines the existence of time series non-linearity in the real output growth
/ recession-term spread relationship. Vector Autoregression (VAR), Threshold VAR
(TVAR), Structural break VAR (SBVAR), Structural break threshold VAR (SBTVAR)
are applied in the analysis. The in-sample results indicate there are non-linear components
in this relationship. And this non-linearity tend to be caused by structural breaks.
The best in-sample model also shows its robustness on arrival of new information in the
out-of-sample tests. We find evidence the model with only structural break non-linearity
outperform linear models in 1-quarter, 3-quarter and 4-quarter ahead forecasting.

Abstract: The Olympic Games are considered to be the most prestigious multi-sport event in the world. 
However, with growing costs associated with hosting such events against a backdrop of questionable economic benefits, and yet elation that follows from sporting success, a number of studies have started to address its intangible or softer impacts as a justification for the investment. 
It is well known that sentiment plays a part in the evolving economic valuation of companies through the stock market. 
What is less well known is how news affects the sentiment towards major public investments like the Olympics. 
In this paper we consider, from the context of the pre-event stage of the 30th Olympiad, the relationship between attitudes towards the Olympics and Olympic-related news; specifically the bad news associated with an increase in the cost of provision, and the good news associated with Team GBs medal success in 2008. 
Using a unique data set and an event-study approach that involves compositional time-series analysis, it is found that good news affects sentiments much more than bad but that the distribution of such sentiment varies widely. 
For example, a much more pronounced effect of good news is identified for females than males, but bad news has less of an impact on the young and older age groups. 
The paper consequently argues that extreme caution should be exercised in policy pronouncements that are based on such sentiments.

Abstract: Do sector-specific factors common to all countries play an important role in explaining business cycle co-movement? 
We address this question by analyzing international co-movements of value added (VA) growth in a multi-sector dynamic factor model. 
The model contains a world factor, country-specific factors, sector-specific factors, and idiosyncratic components. 
We estimate the model using Bayesian methods for 30 disaggregated sectors in the G7 economies for the 1974-2004 period. 
Our findings show that, although there is a substantial role for sector-specific factors, fluctuations are dominated by country-factors. 
The world factor appears to play a minimal role because, when using aggregate data, the world factor captures both the factor common to all countries and industries and the factor common to the same industry across countries. 
We then examine how these factors evolved as globalization deepened over the past two decades. Our results suggest that business cycles at a disaggregate level have not become more synchronized internationally. 
This is mainly driven by a substantial fall in the volatility of world shocks during the globalization period, rather than a lower sensitivity of sectoral growth to world factors. 
Our results also reveal that world factors appear to be more important for industries with a higher level of international vertical integration.

Title: Adding Ideology to the Equation: New Predictions for Election Results under Compulsory Voting
Author-Name: Fernanda L L de Leon

Author-Workplace-Name: University of East Anglia
Abstract: This paper provides new predictions for compulsory elections, taking into
consideration the differences in ideological views between compulsory and voluntary voters. Having explored Brazil's dual voting system, I predict changes
in Americans' preferences and estimate a voting model applied to US senatorial
elections. I find that, if the current voting population had ideological preferences
of a compulsory electorate, Democrats would gain 8.7 percentage points in their
vote shares and win 68% of the elections. Moreover, candidates that are voted
for less would be the ones that gain more votes under compulsory elections, while
this system would be most detrimental for highly voted-for candidates. Another
consequence includes the candidates' reaction while converging in the ideological
spectrum.

Title: Information Acquisition in Ostensibly Efficient Markets

Author-Workplace-Name: University of East Anglia
Abstract: I use U.K. betting exchange data on Wimbledon tennis matches to investigate the Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) paradox. 
Risk-free arbitrage opportunities arise frequently during matches (as information arrives and asynchronously shifts prices), 
but seldom arise before matches (when there is little information to move prices). 
I find that on the few occasions that arbitrage opportunities do arise before matches, they last substantially longer than average. 
This suggests, in line with the paradox, that traders neglect to acquire information (i.e. carry out research, or watch markets) if they believe that markets are already efficient. 
This neglect, in turn, makes markets inefficient.

Title: Immigration Status and Victimization: Evidence from the British Crime Survey
Author-Name: Georgios Papadopoulos
Author-X-Name-First: Georgios
Author-X-Name-Last: Papadopoulos
Author-Workplace-Name: University of East Anglia
Abstract: This study, using data from the British Crime Survey (BCS), examines the microrelationship
between immigration and victimization. We first find that, although immigrants
are more likely to suffer property crimes than natives, this is well explained by the fact that
immigrants exhibit demographic characteristics associated with higher victimization. Contrary
to the above, immigrants are of lower risk of violent victimization. As violence is an
expressive type of crime, where interactions between victim-offender pairs prior to the incident
matter more than instrumental crime, the lower risk of violence can be attributed to
different lifestyle choices associated with lower victimization risks. However, a closer investigation,
decomposing violence in domestic, by acquaintances and by strangers crime, shows
that this difference is driven by the lower crime immigrants suffer by acquaintances and by
family members, which is not consistent with the `different-lifestyles' hypothesis. Nevertheless,
we show that the aforementioned (unexpected) difference cannot be attributed to
higher under-reporting by immigrants. We further show, that if immigrants did not face
racially motivated crime, they would also face a significantly lower risk of victimization by
strangers. Finally, we examine whether the lower victimization by acquaintances could be
because more recent immigrants have fewer acquaintances. However, we argue that if this
kind of `network' effect exists, it is actually quite weak. Therefore, all evidence suggests
that indeed, immigrants face a lower risk of violent victimization because of lifestyles associated
with a lower exposure to crime. Finally, using count data models we examine whether
immigrants are disproportionately victims of repeat crimes. However, the results show that
patterns of repeat victimization are generally the same between immigrants and natives.

Abstract: This paper analyzes sorting pattern of risk-sharing partnerships where
agents are heterogenous in their income riskiness. When preference belongs
to the class of HARA, household production in terms of monetary equivalence
is perfectly transferable between spouses. Hence the characterization of stable
match which minimizes social risk premium crucially depends on the interaction between risks in the household portfolio. In the multiplicative model
where individuals are ranked by their holdings of a common risky stock, the
convexity of household risk premium in joint risk size lead to negative assortative matching. In the additive model where individuals are ranked by their
idiosyncratic risks in the Rothschild-Stiglitz sense, negative sorting is stable if
any Rothschild-Stiglitz deterioration raises local risk aversion a la Ross.

cross-sectional and intertemporal extreme events. We find evidence of the cubic law of
extreme returns, their increasing and asymmetric dependence and of the scaling property
of extreme risk in joint symmetric tails.

Abstract: We study dynamic multilateral markets, in which players' payoffs result from coalitional bargaining.
We establish payoff uniqueness of stationary equilibria and the emergence of endogenous cooperation
structures when traders experience some degree of (heterogeneous) bargaining frictions.
When we focus on market games with different player types, we derive, under mild conditions, an
explicit formula for each type's equilibrium payoff as market frictions vanish. We further apply
this methodology to the analysis of labor markets. From our general results, we can determine the
endogenous composition of the equilibrium firm and the remuneration scheme.

Abstract: The paper proposes an intertemporal model of bargaining among heterogeneous buyers
and sellers placed on a bipartite network. First, it characterizes conditions on the
network under which its trading restrictions are inessential and the outcome is arbitrage-free.
Instead, when the system is segmented in different trading components, we show
how these come about and how prices are determined in each of them. Second, we
turn to the issue of network endogeneity, focusing on those networks that are Pairwise
Stable. Such networks are shown to always exist and be arbitrage-free. In the latter respect,
therefore, they satisfy one of the key properties displayed by frictionless markets.
We identify, however, a sharp contrast regarding another key feature: Pairwise-Stable
networks are generically inefficient if the matching process is genuinely decentralized.
This uncovers a fundamental incompatibility between individual incentives and social
welfare in endogenous trading networks. We explain that such incompatibility is not
only due to buyer/seller heterogeneity but is also caused by the incentives underlying
network formation in a trading context.

Author-Workplace-Name: University of East Anglia
Abstract: This paper studies the individual level relationship between immigration and property
crime in England and Wales using crime self-reports from the Crime and Justice Survey.
Binary and count data models that account for under-reporting of criminal activity are used,
since under-reporting is a major concern in self-reported crime data. The results indicate
that under-reporting is considerably large, but, if anything, immigrants are less likely to
under-report than natives. They also reveal that, once controlling for under-reporting and
for basic demographic characteristics, even though not statistically significant, the effect
of being an immigrant on crime is robustly negative across all model specifications (and
statistically significant in some of those specifications). This might suggest that the negative
association actually exists in the population, but the nature of the regression models in
combination with the data in hand do not allow to estimate the relationship more precisely.
We finally find that the effect of immigration status on property crime differs across regions
and across ethnic groups.

Abstract: This paper studies the comparative statics regarding changes in risk on
Nash's solution to bargaining games with stochastic outcome and disagreement
points. When absolute risk tolerance is linear with constant slope, the Nash's
solution to bargaining with risky outcomes and risky disagreement points can
be viewed as division of divisible certainty equivalent between two risk-averse
agents. We show that whether a deterioration of a bargainer's risky prospect
is advantageous to his opponent often depends on whether preference displays
decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA). Specically, for perfectly correlated
risky prospects, DARA à la Arrow-Pratt works to the concavity of the joint
certainty equivalent with respect to a bargainer's initial wealth or size of risky
exposure; for independent risky prospects, DARA à la Ross vulnerates his risk
bearing under Rothschild-Stiglitz increase in risk taking the form of adding
an independent noise, both leading to the bargainer's increased propensity for
risk aversion as well as the joint size of the pie. These results illuminate how
individual risky prospect as well as risk preference influence the cooperating
partners' income shares and thus the market equilibrum of marriage formation.
We also show that this result is robust under Rubinstein's non-cooperative
bargaining game.

contrast to previous literature, information retrieved from the whole
yield curve is used rather than just the yield spread. Using diâµerent
methods, our models are found to outperform the yield spread models
both in in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting. Notably, the B-spline
fitting model is able to forecast the 2009-2010 recession. Moreover,
Model B show great forecasting ability in out-of-sample output growth
forecasting. In most cases, models based on B-spline perform better
than the ones based on Diebold-Li framework.

Abstract: This paper models the stolen base play in baseball as a simple inspection game.  The model offers equilibrium predictions relating the frequency with which a stolen base play is attempted, and the frequency with which it is successful.  Using an extensive play-by-play dataset from 37 Major League Baseball seasons, qualitative and quantitative support is found for the predictions of the model. An exogenous change in the average number of runs scored per game during the period covered by the dataset provides a natural experiment; the equilbrium model predicts the change in the relationship between attempt and success frequencies observed in the data.

Abstract: Any 2-good direct utility function satisfying standard axioms may be transformed into an indirect utility function, also satisfying standard axioms, by a straightforward change of sign. The reverse is also true. We shall refer to one such function as the `mirror' of the other. It is sometimes the case that the demand function for one of the goods, arising from one utility function, exhibits a particular feature if and only if the mirror utility function exhibits the same feature for the other good. When this occurs, we say that the demand feature in question has the `reflexion property'. It is shown that Giffen behaviour and the necessity/luxury dichotomy are two features of demand that do have this reflexion property. However, it is also shown that the normality/inferiority dichotomy is one feature that does not.

Abstract: We show under general demand and cost conditions that in a mixed duopoly with pollution the government will implement the socially optimal outputs and abatements by a tax-subsidy scheme and keeping the public firm fully public. The scheme requires taxing outputs and subsidizing abatements at diff
erent rates, unlike a pollution tax. Our result contradicts some of the recent claims that social optimum is not implementable and privatization is necessary. We also show that when the private firm is partly foreign-owned, the government will adopt some privatization and will not implement the social optimum, though the social optimum is implementable.

Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between directors' human capital and the company's performance. In particular, we focus on the effect of non-executive directors who are also executive in other firms (independent executives, IE). The analysis is based on a unique dataset of publicly traded firms in the UK which we obtain by matching Extel Financial and Corporate Register data. Our results suggest a positive relationship between the presence of IE on corporate board and company performance. The effect is stronger IEs come from well performing firms. Additionally, the similarity of industries plays a role.

Abstract: We develop a model of bilateral delegation in wage and employment bargaining to study efficiency and distributional implications in monopoly and in Cournot duopoly. In both markets delegation causes underproduction, but has contrasting implications for bargaining pie and for its distribution. In monopoly the bargaining pie contracts. In duopoly the bargaining pie expands, sometimes even up to the collusive level suggesting that delegation is conducive to implicit collusion. Surprisingly, a party's payoff can be inversely related to its bargaining power. The well-known duopoly result of overproduction occurs only in unilateral delegations and when the delegating party is sufficiently strong.

Abstract: The groundbreaking MIT report (1999) was the first study to quantify the disadvantages faced by female scientists. This has been followed by studies of gender pay differentials amongst academics working in the humanities (US), economics (UK and US) and the sciences (US). This paper provides the first detailed study of gender pay differentials amongst scientists working in the UK. Our data allows us to contrast the experiences of scientists working in Higher Education (academic scientists) with those working in Research Institutes (research scientists). We find that there is a gender pay differential of 22% (?6-7,000), most of which can be accounted for in terms of age, grade, subject, research esteem, workplace and domestic responsibilities, but a significant proportion remains unexplained (19% in academic and 30% in research science). Our results suggest that across grades, if female scientists were to receive the same returns as male scientists, the gender pay gap would narrow significantly and would close at the bottom end of the distribution.

Abstract: We examine firms' motivation to change their main bank and how this switch affects loans, interest payments and firm performance after switching. Applying treatment effect analysis on unique firm-bank matched Ukrainian data, we find that larger and highly leveraged companies are more likely to switch their main bank. Importantly, firms tend to switch to a new main bank which holds a higher share of equity in the firm and thereby has stronger power. The results also suggest that firms after switching obtain additional access to bank loans but have on average lower profits due to increased interest payments.

Abstract: We investigate situations in which players make costly contributions as group members in a group conflict, and at the same time engage in contest with fellow group members
to appropriate the possible reward. We introduce within group power asymmetry and
complementarity in members' efforts and analyze how each group's internal conflict influences its chance of winning in the external conflict. We find that the stronger player's
relative contribution to external conflict is higher in a group in which the power distribution is relatively more asymmetric. Furthermore, a more conflictive group may expend
more effort in external conflict if the group exhibits enough degrees of complementarity
in their group effort. The relative payoff of the stronger player also depends on the degree
of complementarity in collective action and it is possible for the weaker player to earn a
higher payoff.

Abstract: We analyze a group contest in which n groups compete to win a group-specific public good prize. Group sizes can be different and any individual player may value the prize differently within and across groups. Players expend costly efforts simultaneously and independently. Only the highest effort (the best-shot) within each group represents the group effort and the winning group is determined by a contest success function. We fully characterize the set of equilibria and show that in any equilibrium at most one player in each group exerts strictly positive effort. There always exists an equilibrium in which only the highest value player in each active group expends positive effort and the contest is reduced to an individual contest between individual players. However, there may also be equilibria in which the highest value players completely free ride on others by exerting no effort. We provide conditions under which this can be avoided and discuss contest design implications.

Abstract: This paper takes advantage of a recent policy experiment in Ukraine's secondary education system to study the effect of stricter requirements for proficiency in the state language on linguistic minority students' demand for, as well as opportunities to pursue, further studies at the university level. The reform that we consider obligated all minority students, including those studying in public schools with a full cycle of education in minority languages, to take a standardized school exit test (which is also a university entry test) in Ukrainian, the state language, thus denying them previously granted access to translated tests. Using school-level data and employing the difference-in-difference estimator we find evidence that the reform resulted in a decline in the number of subjects taken by minority students at the school exit test. There was also a notable shift in the take-up of particular subjects, with fewer exams taken by minority students in more linguistically-demanding subjects such as History, Biology, and Geography, and more exams taken in foreign languages and Math. Overall, our results suggest some distortions in the accumulation of human capital by linguistic minority students induced by the language policy.

Abstract: This paper investigates the determinants of newspapers' provision for political endorsements. I empirically examine the role of newspapers' political preferences and market competition on newspapers' decision. Regression results suggest that market competition inhibits newspapers from making endorsements. Results from a simple model show that newspapers' ideology determine their endorsements, turning partisan papers more likely to make political recommendations and more likely to endorse challengers than non-partisan newspapers.

Abstract: Microdata from the UK Survey of Mortgage Lenders is used to model borrowers' choices between variable and fixed rate mortgages. The data is treated as a large-scale "natural experiment" on risky choice, with the choice of a fixed rate corresponding to the "safe choice" in a more conventional experimental setting. The choice is assumed to depend partly on risk attitude, and partly on expectations of future movements in interest rates. Approximately 280,000 choices, made by borrowers between 1992 and 2001, appear in the sample. The ordered probit model is used for estimation, while taking account of a number of econometric issues including missing counterfactuals, selectivity, and endogeneity. Explanatory variables are divided into three groups: mortgage price variables; interest rate expectations; and borrower characteristics. A large number of strong effects are found, including: fixing is more likely when agents expect interest rates to increase; the presence of female borrowers increases the propensity to fix; older borrowers are less likely to fix; high-income borrowers are less likely to fix, particularly so if income is "self-certified"; those with higher loan-to-value ratios are less likely to fix. These findings amount to new insights in the modelling of choice under risk.Series: University of East Anglia Applied and Financial Economics Working Paper Series

Abstract: This paper studies the effects of social capital on access to bank financing. Based on a Chinese nationwide survey our analysis suggests that entrepreneurs who spend more time on social activities are more likely to obtain a loan from commercial banks. In addition, we find that membership of political parties is an important determinant of state bank financing. Finally, our data reveal some evidence of substitutability between various types of social capital. To get a loan from a specific type of bank, an entrepreneur should access the relevant social network. The results of our analysis are robust to a number of specification checks.

Abstract: The empirical literature on the effect of dispersion of executive remuneration (i.e., the intensity of a tournament structure) on the comparative performance of companies is mixed. Studies on US data tend to find strong positive effects but non-US studies tend to fail to find an effect. This suggests that tournaments are likely to be more effective in some situations than others. Using UK data we are able to exploit differences between companies as they become more ÂAmericanisedÂ to provide some insight into this question. In the UK there has been a change towards the use of the US terminology CEO and away from the more tradition UK nomenclature of MD. A minority of UK companies retain the terminology MD.  Also in some UK companies the top executive is a US citizen. Both these may tell us something about the culture of the company. We test whether tournaments are more likely to be effective if the company calls it top executive CEO and also if there is a US CEO. We find that increasing the dispersion of remuneration is no more effective for companies with CEOs than for MDs. However, we find that the situation is different when we look at companies with US CEOs relative to the rest of the sample. Here we find that increasing the dispersion is associated with better company performance.

Abstract: We examine conditions under which a platform firm can exclude rivals by bundling a product that some on one side of the market regard as essential with its platform, and pursue implications for market performance. We show that the impact of an exclusive dealing contract between the upstream firm and one of the downstream firms on market performance depends on the strength of consumer preferences for the products of the two downstream firms and the relative size of the market segment for which the complementary consumption good is essential. In some cases this may reduce the net social welfare.

Abstract: Apesteguia and Palacios-Huerta (APH, forthcoming) report for a sample of 129 soccer penalty shootouts from various seasons in ten different tournaments that teams kicking first win significantly more often than teams kicking second by a margin of 21 percentage points. Collecting data for 470 shootouts, including all of APH's shootouts, we cannot replicate their result. Teams kicking first win 53.4% of shootouts, which is not significantly different from the a priori expected 50%. Our finding implies that (1) APH's results are not generally robust; (2) using selective subsamples without a coherent criterion for data inclusion might lead to non-representative results.

Abstract: The problem of recognising Giffen behaviour is approached from the standpoint of the Indirect Utility Function (IUF) from which the marshallian demands are easily obtained via Roy's identity. It is shown that, for the two-good situation, downward convergence of the contours of the IUF is necessary for giffenity, and suffcient if this downward convergence is strong enough, in a sense that is geometrically determined. A family of IUFs involving hyperbolic contours convex to the origin, and having this property of (locally) downward convergence is constructed. The marshallian demands are obtained, and the region of Giffen behaviour determined. For this family, such regions exist for each good, and are non-overlapping. Finally, it is shown by geometric construction that the family of Direct Utility Functions having the same pattern of hyperbolic contours also exhibits giffenity in corresponding subregions of the positive quadrant.

Abstract: We show that if two goods whose Indirect Utility Function V (p; q) exhibits the Giffen property for good 1 in some subdomain G(p; q) of the positive quadrant, and if U(x; y) is a Direct Utility Function given by U(x; y) = -V (x; y) and therefore having the same convex contours as V, then U also exhibits the Giffen property for good 2 rather than for good 1, in the corresponding region G(x; y) of the positive (x; y) quadrant. The converse is also true.

Abstract: Two bookmakers compete in Bertrand fashion while setting odds on the outcomes of a sporting contest where an influential punter (or betting syndicate) may bribe some player(s) to fix the contest. Zero profit and bribe prevention may not always hold together. When the influential punter is quite powerful, the bookies may coordinate on prices and earn positive profits for fear of letting the `lemons' (i.e., the influential punter) in. On the other hand, sometimes the bookies make zero profits but also admit match-fixing. When match-fixing occurs, it often involves bribery of only the strong team. The theoretical analysis is intended to address the problem of growing incidence of betting related corruption in world sports including cricket, horse races, tennis, soccer, basketball, wrestling, snooker, etc.

Abstract: This paper investigates the determinants of liability maturity choice in emerging markets using a unique panel of 4,500 Ukrainian firms during the period 2000-2006. Our estimates confirm the importance of agency costs, liquidity, signaling, and taxes for the liability term structure of firms operating in a transition economy. Companies have a demand for long-term external debt mainly due to the shortage of internal funds. Firm creditworthiness and access to long-term financing at bond markets are the key drivers of corporate debt structure. Overall, this study provides strong evidence that constrained and unconstrained companies react differently on liquidity risk and, hence, pursue different debt maturity strategies. As predicted by the theory, our empirical findings demonstrate an adverse effect of retained earnings on debt maturity but a positive relationship between the tax rate and long-term debt.

Abstract: We investigate the link between the propensity to become an entrepreneur and exogenous release from financial constraints in Germany. This is defined in terms of the movement from employment to self-employment on receipt of a financial windfall. A theoretical framework developing Evans and Jovanovic (1989) is set up and tested with panel data from German households. The results show that financial constraints do exist given that individuals are more likely to start a personal business after receiving a windfall gain. The value of windfall gains has a significant but non linear effect on the decision to become self employed. The data reveal that differences in ability and income affect the change in employment status. We also report that there is no evidence that becoming self employed involves the anticipation of windfall gains.

Abstract: Game theory predicts that players make strategic commitments that may appear counter-intuitive. We conducted an experiment to see if people make a counter-intuitive but strategically optimal decision to avoid information. The experiment is based on a sequential Nash demand game in which a responding player can commit ahead of the game not to see what a proposing player demanded. Our data show that subjects do, but only after substantial time, learn to make the optimal strategic commitment. We find only weak evidence of physical timing effects.

Abstract: In recent decades most developed countries have experienced an increase in income inequality. In this paper, we use an equilibrium search framework to shed additional light on what is causing income distribution to change. The major benefit of the model is that it is can accommodate shocks to the skill composition in the market, employee bargaining power and productivity. Further, when our model is subjected to skill-upgrading and changes in employee bargaining power, it is capable of predicting the recent changes observed in the Danish income distribution. The model emphasizes that shocks to the employees' relative productivity, i.e., skill-biased technological change, are unlikely to have caused the increase in income inequality.

Abstract: This paper compares taxes and tradable permits when used to regulate a competitive and polluting downstream industry that can purchase an abatement technology from a monopolistic upstream industry. Second-best policies are derived for the full range of the abatement technology's emission intensities and marginal abatement costs. The second-best permit quantity can be both above or below the socially optimal emission level. Explicit consideration of the output market provides further insights on how market power distorts the allocation in the downstream industry. The ranking between permits and taxes is ambiguous in general, but taxes weakly dominate permits if full diffusion is socially optimal. In addition, it is analysed how a cap on the permit price affects the diffusion of an abatement technology.

Abstract: We analyze the impact of a freeway interchange collapse in the San Francisco Bay area on the difference in airfare quotes for travel into the area's main airports.  The incident temporarily made Oakland airport a less attractive choice for traveling to San Francisco. Using a sample of fare quotes collected on-line we find that fares for travel into Oakland were 6-7 percent lower while the interchange was out of service. Our results imply that the demand-side shock was well absorbed by the supply side, and adjustment of prices and return to the status quo once the shock vanished was swift.

Abstract: We estimate firms' cash flow sensitivity of cash to empirically  test how the financial system's structure and activity level influence their financial constraints. For this purpose we merge  Almeida et al. (2004), a path-breaking new design for evaluating a firm's financial constraints, with Levine (2002), who paved the way for comparative analysis of financial systems around the world. We conjecture that a country's financial system, both in terms of its structure and its level of development,  influences the cash flow sensitivity of cash of constrained firms but leaves unconstrained firms unaffected. We test our hypothesis with a large international sample of 80,000 firm-years from 1989 to 2006. Our findings reveal that both the structure of the financial system and its level of development matter. Bank-based financial systems provide the constrained firms with easier access to external financing.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the effects of parliamentary election cycles on the Turkish banking system. Using annual bank-level data representing all banks in Turkey during  1963-2005,  we find that there are meaningful differences in the structure of assets, liabilities and financial performance across different stages of the parliamentary election cycle. However, we find that government-owned banks operate similarly to both domestic and foreign-owned private sector banks before, during and after elections. Our estimates also show that government-owned banks underperform their domestic and foreign-owned private sector counterparts.

Abstract: The paper explores factors that lead to accumulation or decumulation of firms' cash reserves. In particular, we empirically examine whether additional future fixed capital and R&D investment expenditures induce firms to change their liquidity ratio while considering the role of market imperfections. Implementing a dynamic framework on a panel of US, UK and German companies, we find that firms make larger adjustments to cash holdings when they plan additional future R&D rather than fixed capital investment expenditures. This behavior is particularly prevalent among financially constrained firms that are heavily involved in R&D activities. We also show that the cash flow sensitivity of cash is substantially higher for financially constrained firms than for their unconstrained counterparts in all three countries.
