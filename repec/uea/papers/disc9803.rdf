Title: On the theory of reference-dependent preferences (revised)
Abstract: A theory is proposed in which preferences are conditional
 on reference points.  It is related to Tversky and Kahneman's
 reference-dependent preference theory, but is simpler and deviates
 less from conventional consumer theory.  Preferences conditional
 on any given reference point satisfy standard assumptions. 
 Apart from a continuity condition, the only additional restriction is
 to rule out cycles of pairwise choice.  The theory is consistent with
 observations of status quo bias and related effects.  Reference points
 are treated as subject to change during the course of trade.  The
 implications of endogeneity of reference points for behaviour in
 markets are investigated.

Title: Focal Points, Preferences and the Generation of Meaning

Abstract:  In this paper we introduce a unique and influential
  	psychoanalytical theory based upon a theory of linguistics developed
  	by Jaques Lacan.  Although Lacan is primarily concerned with
  	psychoanalytical issues, his work has already entered other
  	theoretical realms such as sociology, philosophy and literary
  	criticism.  We argue that an application of Lacan's ideas to the
  	concept of focal points leads us to emphasise the integration of the
  	conceptualisation of focal points and preferences .   We argue that
  	it is insufficient to view salience as an extra or special
  	consideration that must be in some way made commensurate with our
  	notions of rational choice.  Rather, the significance of focal
  	points should be interpreted in terms of preferences. We argue that
  	when an individual makes a choice, what they reveal is a psycho-
  	social structure, or what we call a 'structure of salience.'  This
  	is to emphasise that we wish to challenge the  current understanding
  	of the term 'salient' and to draw it closer to preference analysis
  	in general.   The terminology applied by some ascribes the term
  	salience only when it is easy to recognise that the direct
  	connection between desire and the achievement of satisfaction
  	through rational choice is prevented by incomplete preference.  That
  	is, at the aggregate level where focal points are exhibited by the
  	dominance of symbols in language.  We argue that the connection
  	between desire and rational choice is always mediated by language
  	and that language itself is a structure of salience based on psycho-
  	social linguistic relations.  It is argued that this paper provides
  	an important comment on the nature and significance of focal points
  	and their relationship to preferences in general.

Abstract: Is the rapid growth of experimental research in economics evidence of a new scientific spirit at
	work or merely fresh evidence of a misplaced desire to ape the methods of natural sciences? It
	is often argued that economic experiments are artificial in some sense which tends to render the
	results problematic or uninteresting. In the early part of this paper I argue that this artificiality
	critique does not provide a convincing philosophical objection to experimentation in economics.
	Later sections of the paper argue that methodological discourse in relation to experiments has
	become somewhat polarized: experimentalists have promoted a position which seeks to defuse
	objections to experiments; theorists have taken up positions which insulate theory from
	experimental challenge. I argue that these strategies are overly defensive and tend to stifle rather
	than promote the goals of economic enquiry.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether European integration has an effect on the geographical con-centration of Swedish multinationals' production inside the European Union. The results indi-cate that agglomeration and dispersion forces are present, and that the relative strength of these forces has been affected by the EU integration process. In particular, the European inte-gration process has reduced intra-EU transaction costs, and thus the need of R&D intensive multinationals to engage in local production to fully appropriate the return of their assets. The results further suggest that EU integration has led Swedish MNEs to increase dispersion of production inside the European Union.

Length: 27 pages
Abstract: We compare the random preference, Fechner, and constant error (or "tremble") approaches to the stochastic modelling of choice under risk. Various combinations of these approaches are used with expected utility and rank-dependent theory to generate a set of econometric models. These are estimated in a random effects framework using experimental data from two samples of 46 subjects who each faced 90 pairwise choice problems. The best fitting model uses the random preferences approach with an added tremble mechanism, in conjunction with rank-dependent theory. As subject gain experience, trembles become less frequent and there is less deviation from expected utility theory.

Title: The Domestic Market Effect: a Strategic Model of the Choice between Exporting and Multinational Production with Cost-Reducing R&D Expenditures.
Author-Name: Pavelin, S.
Keywords: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ; ECONOMIC MODELS ; INTERNATIONAL TRADE ; TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS
Length: 27 pages
Abstract: This paper looks at the interaction between two firms based in different countries, each which faces the export v MNE choice concerning the servicing of the other's home market. Firms also have a choice over investment in a new technology which allows a corporate wide reduction in variable costs (e.g. cost reducing R&D). Results show that the strategic motives of firms can lead key parameters to influence the export v MNE choice in a more complex way than they do absent investment. In a two firm, leader-follower model, under certain parameterisations, there is a non-monotonic relationship between tariffs and multinationality. Furthermore, the interactions between these two choices ensures that the export v MNE choice can influence domestic market conditions. This is most clearly seen where a firm chooses to be a multinational even though it would receive higher profits from the foreign market were it to export. It does so in order to deter its rival from investing in the new, cost reducing technology, placing it at an advantage in both domestic and foreign markets.

Title: Monopoly in the UK: What Determines whether the MMC finds against the Investigated Firms?.
Author-Name: Davies, S.W.

Author-Name: Clarke, R.
Keywords: MONOPOLIES ; MARKET STRUCTURE ; MERGERS
Length: 25 pages
Abstract: This paper draws on data from 73 UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission reports on monopoly between 1973 and 1995. It shows that there is a roughly two in three chance that the Commission will come to an adverse conclusion against the investigated firms in a given case. although the underlying philosophy of UK policy in this area has always been based on a case-by-case approach (in which precedent plays little part), the model demonstrates that a significant majority of MMC decisions are predictable using a very simple probit model, based on standard, readily observable characteristics. Specifically, 75-80% of decisions can be explained purely in terms of the market share of the leading firm (but not those f the second and third ranked firms), and knowledge of the broad nature of the alleged anti-competitive practice. An adverse finding is most likely in cases involving exclusive dealing, and least likely where other vertical restraints are involved.

Length: 20 pages
Abstract: There exist large variations in juvenile sex ratios across districts and social groups in India. Economic and cultural factors have been advanced as contending explanations for these variations. We propose a household optimization model that integrates cultural explanations with economic ones. We estimate this model using data from 1961, 1971 and 1981 censuses. We use cross section and panel data estimation, with and without restrictions, estimate fixed and random effects models, and use first differencing to eliminate district effects. We find that female labour force participation, female literacy, and the predominance of the Indo-Aryan kinship system in a district account for much of the variation in juvenile sex ratios.

Title: Missing Women in Indian Districts: an Entitlements Approach.
Author-Name: Agnihotri, S.

Author-Name: Parikh, A.
Keywords: MORTALITY ; WOMEN ; DEMOGRAPHY ; INDIA
Length: 32 pages
Abstract: The ratio of women to men in India reveals excess female mortality by comparison with developed countries; this excess is socially not naturally determined. Juvenile sex ratios combine excess male infant mortality in poor health environments with excess female child mortality due to discrimination. Variations in sex ratios have been explained in terms of kinship practices and female labour participation. However, these variables are interrelated with each other and with other demographic and economic variables, and are spatially confounded. We present an entitlements approach to the analysis of juvenile sex ratios, disaggregated by social group and within the juvenile age range. The spatial lag model is preferred to the spatial error model on empirical grounds. Low female labour participation is an important determinant of anti-female child bias for all kinship systems of the country, but in Districts characterised by the Indo-Aryan kinship and culture the effect of female labour participation is much more significant.

Title: Endogeneizing Switching Costs: Mix and Match in a Dynamic Framework.
Author-Name: Marinoso, B.G.
Keywords: CONSUMPTION ; COSTS ; ECONOMIC MODELS
Length: 29 pages
Abstract: This paper analyses how sequential purchase of the different components assembled in some consumption good affects firm's pricing behaviour and compatibility decisions. With incompatible brands, consumers who wish to purchase some component of an alternative brand are forced to replace the durable parts they already own, thus the price of these durable parts can be considered as an endogenous switching cost. we examine how pricing incentives depend on oligopolistic rivalry and on whether firms are multiproduct or not. Finally, we explore the time consistency and welfare implications of technological choice.

Title: Does Technological Innovation Improve Household Food Security??

Length: 21 pages
Abstract: In this paper, the production and consumption behaviour of food-secure and food-insecure farm households are studied in the presence of technological change. The technological change on the whole tends to imprve the food security status of the households. Research based technology (wheat variety and fertiliser rate for improved variety) versus farmer based innovation (tef crop and Bunigne tef variety) indicated that the adoption of the latter provided household food security. This evidence is based on the study of 96 farm households in Ethiopia.

Title: SEM and the Changing Structure of EU Manufacturing, 1987-1993.
Author-Name: Davies, S.
Author-Name: Rondi, L.
Author-Name: Sembenelli, A.
Keywords: TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS ; BUSINESS ORGANIZATION ; MARKET STRUCTURE ;ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
Length: 53 pages
Abstract: This paper reports the initial results from a project designed to track the evolution of industrial and corporate structure of EU manufacturing alongside the ongoing European integration process. At the heart of the work is the construction of an "EU market share matrix" for 1993. This includes estimates of the turnovers of a set of 300 leading manufacturing firms, disaggregated across nearly 100 industries, and then, in turn, across the individual member states. This allows us to estimate the extent of diversification and intra-EU multinationality for each of the firms, and the concentration of producers and measures of geographical concentration for each of the industries. When coupled with a similar matrix for 1987, first reported in Davies, Lyons et al (1996), this provides a rich and detailed mapping of how these structural dimensions have changed with the final stage (so far as the legislation is concerned) of the European single market programme. In effect, our work provides a complement to the EC's own evaluation (1996) which was derived mainly from published aggregate data on FDI, trade and mergers. In contrast, our work is more micro-based, using company accounts and emphasising industrial structure.

Title: A Solution to the Problem of Deception in Economics Experiments.
Author-Name: Bardsley, N.
Keywords: EXPERIMENTS
Length: 11 pages
Abstract: This paper outlines a method of procuring the benefits of deception in experiments without actually deceiving subjects, which should be suitable for many experimental economics environments. This is done by a modification of an already standard design, the Random Lottery incentive system, which replaces the deceptive scenarios of designs which use deceit with fictitious scenarios, each of which, from a subject's viewpoint, has a chance of being true. It is shown that Weimann's (1994) experiment, which used deception, could be re-run using the new design so as to eliminate the deception completely.

abstract: This paper examines the implications of habit forming hypothesis for welfare theory. both myopic and rational habit forming models are discussed. First, I analyse the main criteria proposed by myopic habit forming models for measuring individual and social welfare. I show that they are undermined by the same sort of problem: the need of information that cannot inferred from individuals' behaviour. Then I analyse rational habit-forming models. I show that to regain the traditional correspondence between preference-choice-welfare these models need to refer to a cardinal concept of utility. I also show that Harsanyi's correspondence rule for welfare measurements can use an ordinal concept of utility only because the author does not take into account all the consequences deriving from habit-forming hypothesis

author-name: Pfaffermayer, M.

length: 23 pages
abstract: Conjectural variation models are popular in empirical research as they infer the degree of market power from real data. IO-theorists, however, disapprove it for lack of theoretical foundation, arguing that dynamic reactions are forced into a static model with the strategy space and time horizon only loosely defined. The presented model follows an idea put forward by Cabral (1995) and demonstrates that the CV-model can be interpreted as the joint profit maximising steady state reduced form of a price setting supergame in a differentiated product market under optimal punishment strategies. For the symmetric two firm case the CV-parameter is shown to cover the full range of possible outcomes depending on product differentiation, market growth, bankruptcy risk and the discount rate.

title: Playing Away to Win at Home: A Strategic Model of the Choice Between Exporting and Multinational Production with Cost-Reducing R&D Expenditures.
author-name: Pavelin, S.
keywords: TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS ; PRODUCTION
length: 24 pages
abstract: The strategic literature on the choice between exporting and multinational production has looked only at the interaction between either (i) a single potential multinational (based in country A) and a single (or set of) domestic firm(s) (based in country B) or (ii) two potential MNEs based in different countries (one in A and one in B). This paper departs from that structure to look at the interaction between two firms based in the same country, each of which faces the export, MNE choice concerning the servicing of a second country's market. Furthermore, firms have a choice over investment in a new technology which allows a corporate wide reduction in variable costs (eg cost reducing R&D). A two firm, leader-follower model is employed and it is found that under certain parameterisations we obtain a non-monotonic relationship between tariffs and multinationality. It is also possible that a firm will choose to be a multinational even though they would receive higher profits from the foreign market were they to export. They do so in order to deter their rivals from investing in the new, cost reducing technology.

The model fills a gap in incomplete contract theories, which for the most part assume timeless contracting, or contracts which last for the full life of a specific investment. The model reveals an asymmetry between buyer and seller investment, and the precise sense in which duration can be expected to depend on specific investments. It also addresses the importance of the background legal system.

As a practising experimentalist, I am convinced that experiments do have the potential to make a significant contribution to knowledge in economics.
