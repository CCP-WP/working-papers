Abstract: In this article we chart the development of competition and deregulation of the British retail energy markets, explaining the evolution of competitive constraints when consumers are introduced to supplier choice for the first time.  In the context of rising real energy prices for consumers, and continued market power on the part of incumbents, we address the question of whether the control of pricing practices through the ex post provisions of the general competition law is sufficient to protect consumers.  We also explore the issue of whether reliance solely on these provisions is desirable given the uncertainty which surrounds the application of the Chapter II prohibition (governing abuse of dominance), specifically in respect of price discrimination in final markets.  We conclude that the outcome of the liberalisation experiment in terms of delivering benefits for consumers is unclear.

Title: The Role of State Attorneys General in U.S. Antitrust Policy: Public Enforcement through Private Enforcement Methods

Abstract: This paper discusses the role of State Attorneys General in the enforcement of the federal antitrust laws in the U.S.  It provides a substantial background on the doctrinal roots of the State Attorney General’s power to enforce federal antitrust laws.  Then, it analyses the advantages of the state enforcement mechanism both in terms of providing redress to consumers and deterrence to undertakings.  Building upon this framework and the empirical data on state enforcement, the paper critically analyses the proposals of the Antitrust Modernization Commission on state enforcement.  It suggests that the State Attorneys General constitute a vital part of the federal antitrust scheme, and problems associated with their enforcement efforts are largely over-stated.  Even if there really is a danger of over-enforcement, the paper argues that the problem can be solved through less dramatic amendments.

Abstract: This paper questions whether discrimination between consumers by a dominant undertaking can and should constitute an abuse of a dominant position under Article 82EC.  By finding that it can, the paper challenges the traditional interpretation of the discrimination ban under that provision, namely that discrimination constitutes abuse only when directed against the intermediate customers of the dominant undertaking.  As such, the paper seeks to clarify the scope of Article 82EC as regards discrimination, and elaborate on whether discrimination between consumers should be abusive. This is done from both a law and an economics perspective, in order to put forward a proposal to ensure that competition law does not prohibit discrimination where economics finds it potentially welfare enhancing.

Abstract: This paper shows how separately itemised surcharges potentially facilitate collusion during a temporary cost shock if firms commit to their duration.  A duopoly model with price-matching punishments shows that if firms set higher prices they only receive punishment during the shock because they expect prices to fall in the future regardless of a deviation.  When it is likely that costs will fall in the future, the price-matching punishment is too small to increase prices, so firms maintain rigid prices.  When it is unlikely that costs will fall the punishment is harsh enough to sustain marginally higher supracompetitive prices.  However, if firms commit to surcharges for the shock’s duration they are able to set even higher prices, because surcharges effectively commit firms to a price decrease and so threaten a harsher punishment after the cost shock has ended.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the Somerfield decision of the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT). In that decision, the CAT demonstrated a high degree of deference to the Competition Commission where the latter was scoping divestiture remedies in a merger case. This approach is consistent with the case law of the US and EC and, it is argued, is appropriate given the need for procedural expediency. The decision is placed in the wider context of the debates over the efficacy of merger remedies and the appropriate limits of judicial supervision of agency discretion in this area.

Abstract: This paper analyses the impact of the transition from price-cap regulation (deposit/loan rate control) to rate-of-return regulation (ROA, NPLs and/or BIS ratio) on banking industry structure. A simple theoretical model of banking competition suggests that the relative dominance of the two objective functions under different regulatory regimes affects the market structure. Imposing more stringent rate-of-return regulation, whilst relaxing price-cap regulation, reduces the equilibrium number of banks. The result from the theoretical model is also supported by empirical evidence from Korea, which has undergone substantial consolidation in recent years. The empirical analysis uses a unique data set of the entire commercial banking sector in Korea between 1976 and 2003, which covers both pre- and post- banking crisis periods.

Abstract: In applications as diverse as banking, supermarket and catalogue sales, it has been clearly identified that prices have a strong propensity to cluster around certain digits. This study forwards an explanation and empirical investigation of price clustering in retail markets, through an examination of how interest rates cluster in two UK financial services markets. It is proposed that price or interest rate clustering forms in retail markets as firms wish to maximise returns from customers who have difficulties in recalling and processing price information.  To compensate for limited recall, individuals use different behavioural strategies, such as rounding and truncating number information, which are recognised by firms when setting prices or interest rates. This theory is developed and tested using a dataset of retail interest rates from the UK which enables interest rate clustering to be viewed in both lending and investment markets, and at different levels of financial involvement.  It is found that interest rate clustering occurs in a manner consistent with firms maximising returns from customers who have less ability in recalling and processing number information. Further, the degree of interest rate clustering observed is exaggerated for investors of smaller monetary quantities, for firms which profit maximise and at higher market rates of interest.

Abstract: Turkish electricity reform is entering a new phase through the Turkish Government’s proposal to create 21 new distribution companies, 18 of them through merger.  Two aspects of merger analysis are the operational cost savings and the potential production efficiency gains.  This paper concentrates on the second aspect and uses a recently developed methodology to assess the potential effect of these mergers and whether these mergers are efficiency enhancing.  This is performed by comparing the actual efficiency levels of observed distribution companies with the merger of proposed aggregated companies.  The model is calibrated on panel data from 1999 to 2003 which include measures of physical capital and labour inputs, as well as customer and energy related outputs.  The results indicate potential for considerable efficiency gains from the proposed mergers.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of dynamic indefinite horizon R&D races with uncertainty and multiple prizes. The theoretical predictions are highly sensitive: small parameter changes determine whether technological competition is sustained over time or converges into a market structure with an entrenched leadership and lower aggregate R&D research. The subjects' strategies are far less sensitive. In three out of four treatments (with the exception being a control treatment), the R&D races tend to converge to entrenched leadership. Investment is highest when rivals are close, and there is evidence of average over-investment.

Abstract: The past and current reluctance of firms and individuals to use private enforcement suggests that there are limited incentives for self-help. The key contribution of private enforcement to overall deterrence derives from cases which would not otherwise be brought, not simply because of resource constraints, but also because relevant information would not otherwise have come to light. In terms of revealing such private information, cases initiated and pursued by private litigants add much more to the equation than do cases merely following-on from decisions made by competition authorities. In this paper we use a simple model to highlight what features of the private enforcement system promote and hamper the use of these two different types of private enforcement. A key finding is that that to encourage new cases, it is essential that private enforcement is quicker than the time it takes to get a decision in a follow-on case.

Abstract: This paper develops a signalling model to look at some effects of the inclusion of an efficiency defence in merger regulation. By incorporating Type I and Type II errors into the antitrust agency's pay-off function approval probabilities are endogenized. The agency can choose to use a fuzzy approval rule (mixed strategies) after observing a double signal (produced evidence and the way it has been produced) as a tool to (partially) separate different merger types by changing approval probabilities and, consequently, firms' expected payoffs from a merger. The separation leads to a lower value of the expected mistake by the agency. If the agency can commit to certain policies, then a fuzzy approval rule is preferred under a wide range of parameters.

Abstract: This paper investigates competition between chain-stores and independents in the UK opticians’ industry, using the relationship between the number of outlets present in a local market and the market size. Chain-stores are shown to have a significant effect on local market competition. In addition, the empirical approach is extended to allow inferences on the nature and extent of product differentiation. The results are broadly consistent with a model of vertical product differentiation in which chain-stores adopt national pricing strategies. The evidence suggests that the nature of competition between independent retailers depends on whether a chain-store is present.

Abstract: The ‘two-thirds rule’ stands as a caveat to the quantitative jurisdictional thresholds stipulated in the Merger Regulations. It prevents the attribution of a 'Community dimension' to large business mergers where two-thirds of the parties' respective turnovers are made in one and the same member state. It sees the relevant national authority and not the European Commission enjoy competence to assess the competitive effects of such a transaction. In the immediate aftermath of Gas Natural/Endesa - a case which the European Commission accepted only reluctantly did not possess a Community dimension - the Competition Commissioner mooted the legislative repeal of the two-thirds rule. The reception by member states of a proposal on these lines is unlikely to be uniformly generous. This note first reviews the origins and content of the two-thirds rule, before proceeding to consider the current momentum behind and prospects for successful reform. It suggests that a wider rapprochement between divergent perspectives on the best approach to achieving economic development both within and across the member states of the EC – and in particular on the problematic issue of support for ‘national champions’ – will likely be necessary before any revision can occur.

Abstract: Where fines are the only available sanction against cartels there is a trade-off between increased deterrence and the increased risk of insolvency. Higher fines are unacceptable to the European Commission because of the costs and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These concerns have led to the emergence of a ‘financial constraints’ discount which is applied with a lack of transparency and may be strongly influenced by the EC treaty objectives of protecting employment and social justice. Such bankruptcy discounts encourage infringing firms to paint as gloomy a picture of their financial situation as possible to reduce their cost of collusion. They also provoke cartel members into raising prices further, safe in the knowledge that they will never incur fines high enough to threaten their financial viability. The existence in the US of a parallel ‘loose’ bankruptcy discount allows international infringing firms to cite sanctions previously incurred in the US as grounds for ‘financial constraints’ in Europe. The effect is lower fines to the detriment of EC deterrence and international enforcement.

The empirical result is supported by evidence from Japan and Korea, which have undergone a substantial consolidation following a series of deregulation. The analysis is applied to a unique data set of the entire commercial banking sector in Japan and Korea, which covers both pre- and post- banking crisis periods. The paper also draws attention to the role of banking sector in the East Asian industrialisation, which influenced its idiosyncratic banking regulation and the evolution of the banking structure using the structure-performance relationship.

Abstract: This paper analyses the behaviour of banks’ customers when a new technology (internet banking) is introduced. The determinants of consumer adoption of internet banking are characterised using survey data from Korea in both static and dynamic framework. There is evidence that adoption of internet banking is influenced by sex, age, marital status, degree of exposure to internet banking, and the characteristics of the banks. A duration analysis shows no evidence of first mover advantage (order effects) in internet banking whilst the largest bank (rank effects) in commercial banking remains dominant in internet banking. The results imply that the internet banking adoption is dominated by social norm effects.

Abstract: The structure of conglomerates embedded in the strong vertical ownership network in East Asia was believed to be a driving force for the economic success but was also blamed for the recent financial crisis in Asia given the fallacy – too big to collapse. This paper introduces a notion of collective relationship banking (CRB) as a mechanism for monitoring private information and investigates the likelihood of such banking relationship when the borrowing firms have heterogeneous vertical ownership structure using a Korean firm level panel dataset. Policy concerns are then addressed since the post-crisis corporate restructuring may create a more concentrated banking relationship with a few dominant banks.

Abstract: Although the 1996 ‘Notice on the non-imposition or reduction of fines in cartel cases’ has been criticised by academics as lacking clarity and certainty, it has been described in European Commission literature as an ‘indisputable success’ and as having played an ‘instrumental role’ in uncovering and punishing secret cartels. This paper makes an empirical assessment of horizontal cartel cases in the EC opened as a result of leniency applications under the 1996 notice. Nearly three quarters of the cartels apparently uncovered by this notice were subject to equivalent prior or simultaneous investigations in the U.S. In addition, most of the cartels that were revealed operated in the Chemical industry, were all connected to each other by virtue of the same firms’ involvement in more than one cartel, and all failed or ceased to operate before being revealed to the Commission by a cartel member. These two findings would suggest that the 1996 leniency notice was only of limited success in inducing firms to reveal cartels and that most applications for immunity were as a natural consequence of cartels failing and firms looking once more to their own interests rather than those of the cartel. The leniency notice largely succeeded in uncovering failed cartels, not active ones.

Abstract: Within a one-shot, duopoly game, we show that firms cannot use false instore price comparisons to deter rational consumers from further beneficial price search in an effort to create market power. However, by introducing a consumer protection authority that monitors price comparisons, we formalise Nelson’s (1974) conjecture by showing that ‘middle-order’ monitoring can actually facilitate the deception of fully rational consumers, to deter them from otherwise optimal search. Despite this effect, we show that no increase in monitoring can ever harm consumers thanks to a second, larger effect that improves consumer information and increases the intensity of price competition.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the Most-Favoured-Customer (MFC) clause identified in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) Report on Foreign Package Holidays behaves not like an MFC but rather as if it was a variant of a so far unstudied price matching guarantee. This provides a clearer explanation than that by the MMC of why the guarantee is not in the public interest. The subsequent Court of Appeal decision focused attention on whether or not the MFC came with matching funding. It correctly identified that this made a difference, but was wrong in claiming that with matching funding the MFC would benefit consumers. As a result, the latest Foreign Package Holidays Order still does not provide the necessary prohibition of MFC clauses.

Title: Waterbed Effects and Buyer Mergers

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how a profitable, downstream merger can lower the merged entity’s input price while raising that of its rivals, leading to an adverse effect on final consumers. This novel ‘waterbed’ result is surprising and very different to the unilateral and co-ordinated effects usually considered in the analysis of horizontal mergers. When demand is linear, all mergers involving a powerful buyer harm overall welfare even though the merger leads to marginal cost reductions that substantially increase output by the merged entity.

Title: The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act: Has Information Pooling Led to Anticompetitive Behaviour in the US Beef Industry?

Abstract: Cointegration analysis has been used to assist the testing for price delineation in antitrust and merger cases as a way of deepening econometric evidence. This paper examines the impact of the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act (1999) instigated in 2001. By addressing the industry as a cointegrated system containing retail, wholesale and farm prices, short run and long run relationships were examined. Cointegration analysis between farm, wholesale and retail sectors suggests that the wholesale sector plays an important role within system. The econometric estimations find that long run wholesale pricing is weakly exogenous whilst farm and retail prices follow the same trend. This finding suggests that it may be as a result of market inefficiency and calls for further analysis of the role that the wholesale sector plays within the industry.

Abstract: This policy paper offers a synthesis of research on privatisation and its impacts on the utilities sector in different countries. It identifies issues to be considered by policy makers concerned with economic reform, including the implications of sequencing privatisation together with competition, regulation and industry restructuring; the role and importance of an independent regulatory agency; and the impact of introducing competition into utility markets. In addition to assessing reform through the more conventional method of examining productivity gains, it considers the distribution of the broader benefits from reform among key stakeholders –government, investors and consumers.

Abstract: Delineation of the relevant market forms a pivotal part of most antitrust cases. The standard approach is sequential. First the product market is delineated, then the geographical market is defined. Demand and supply substitution in both the product dimension and the geographical dimension will normally be stronger than substitution in either dimension. By ignoring this one might decide first to define products narrowly and then to define the geographical extent narrowly ignoring the possibility of a diagonal substitution. These reflections are important in the empirical delineation of product and geographical markets. Using a unique data set for prices of Norwegian and Scottish salmon, we propose a methodology for simultaneous market delineation and we demonstrate that compared to a sequential approach conclusions will be reversed.

Title: Raising Rivals' Fixed Cost

Abstract: This paper analyses the strategic use of fixed costs to deter entry or monopolize a market in a standard Cournot framework. First of all a general case shows how the presence of fixed costs can affect the possible equilibria to the Cournot game. It is shown that the presence of a firm with a first-mover advantage can have important implications if fixed costs are raised. In addition the forward induction process becomes important in determining plausible equilibria. The use of firstly regulation and secondly ‘nuisance’ law-suits are considered as strategies to increase fixed costs.

Title: Price Deception, Market Power and Consumer Policy

Abstract:  This paper presents a model in which a firm attempts to gain market power by pricing above the competitive market price and simply trying to persuade illinformed consumers not to search for other lower priced firms. Fictitious price comparisons, or false sale signs could be used in this way to deceptively and profitably deter consumer search. A simplified model shows how this mechanism could exist when combined with moderately enforced consumer regulatory policy.
