Abstract: This article proposes an empirical method for finding the determinants of the size of remedy offers relative to the level required by the European Commission in individual cases. Evidence is presented that merger characteristics, such as the size of the transaction, or the number of horizontal overlaps do not affect the probability of a remedy offer being successful. It is also shown that pre-merger expectations about merger-generated efficiencies increase the likelihood of successful offers. These findings are very important features of EC merger control, and a novelty in the existing literature. If parties are delay-averse, then the complexity of the case matters very little, as merging parties appear to be able to offer something outright acceptable for the Commission. This may lead to a counter-productive situation where less delay-averse mergers become more prone to offering too much, which can result in over-fixing the competition problem for those mergers where savings would be more likely.

Abstract: This article looks at the distribution of two EC merger procedural events and examines the effect of the indefinite-length suspension of merger investigations. Although the ECMR refers to the suspension of investigations as an exceptional instrument, it is used in a high proportion of cases. As the ECMR does not set a time limit for suspension, it can lead to significant delay in the assessment of mergers. To understand the causes of delay, this article relies on the fact that the suspension of the investigation is a consequence of merging parties’ failure to provide the necessary information to the Commission. Two main causes of this behaviour are identified. Firstly, merging parties may decide to intentionally withhold information in order to cause the suspension of the investigation, which allows them more time to do whatever is necessary to avoid a lengthy second phase investigation. Secondly, failure to provide the required information to the Commission may be a result of merging parties’ negligence towards the regulatory assessment of their merger. Whereas the first case may be socially beneficial, identifying the second type of behaviour may help in filtering out inefficient mergers.

Abstract: Cartel practices attract enormous corporate fines, even where they only involve a handful of employees. Internal compliance programmes are thought to protect firms by training employees and auditing their activities. However, this paper argues that such programmes are ineffective because cartelists typically know what they are doing is illegal, go to great lengths to avoid detection and are usually senior managers. Moreover, compliance programmes do not mitigate cartel fines, despite their being imposed on the whole corporation years after an infringement has occurred. It is argued that the threat of criminal sanctions against individuals is essential to effective internal compliance.

Abstract: This paper examines the joint pricing of credit insurance and unsecured lending. This case has wider regulatory implications following concerns that the sale of credit insurance as a secondary or add-on product has resulted in uncompetitive pricing, limited product utility and possible misselling. To explore these concerns a theoretical model is developed in which banks set prices for customers who have varying decision making ability. The model predictions are tested empirically. It is concluded that banks crosssubsidise unsecured lending by setting high credit insurance premiums. The form of sales and profit maximising by banks is central to causing such a cross-subsidy to arise. This cross-subsidy is observed to decline over time and is far more pronounced for proprietary rather than mutually owed banks.

Title: Can the Commission use Article 82EC to Combat Tacit Collusion?

Abstract: Recent events suggest that Article 82 may prohibit abusive and tacitly collusive conduct. Yet can the Commission enforce this law? In this article I argue it cannot. I tackle this question of enforcement from the perspective of proof and examine to what extent the Commission can establish the conduct of tacit collusion. I show that proof of tacit collusion requires the Commission to overcome a difficult problem of identification, notably how to distinguish tacit collusion from other very subtle conducts like unconscious parallelism and undetected overt collusion. I argue that the Commission cannot resolve this problem by establishing the typical conditions drawn from case law, such as the lack of effective competition, the Airtours criterion and a focal point, as this proof cannot mitigate error sufficiently. This seeks the Commission to produce greater cogency of evidence, yet only at the expense of rendering enforcement prohibitively onerous. I conclude that owing to a problem of proof (detection) Article 82 is unenforceable and can neither punish nor deter tacit collusion. This makes a policy of using Article 82 to combat tacit collusion ex post misconceived and suggests that tacit collusion admits only an ex ante legal treatment.

Abstract: The aims of this paper are twofold. First, I explain the economics of bank bailouts as distinct from bailouts for other sectors of the economy. Why do all the rules of good competition policy appear to fly out of the window when the banks get into trouble? Does this mean that we should abandon the rules equally for car manufacturers and other industries in trouble? I argue that a unique combination of two characteristics make it essential to bailout or nationalise the banks in the current crisis. No other sector of the economy can claim the same justification. Second, I review the threat of a retreat to politically-determined industrial policy and the need for vigilant implementation of economic effects-based competition policy.

Abstract: It is well known that search costs and switching costs can create market power by constraining the ability of consumers to change suppliers. While previous research has examined each cost in isolation, this paper demonstrates the benefits of examining the two types of friction in unison. The paper shows how subtle distinctions between the two costs can provide important differences in their effects upon consumer behaviour, competition and welfare. In addition, the paper also illustrates a simple empirical methodology for estimating separate measures of both costs, while demonstrating a potential bias that can arise if only one cost is considered.

Abstract: This study examines if, and how, branding constitutes an anticompetitive act. These questions are assessed through an examination of UK competition cases undertaken over the period 1950-2007. From this assessment it is observed that branding can facilitate excessive pricing, requires vertical restraints, and can lead to consumer confusion. Competition cases focused on branding issues are demonstrably different from cases without branding concerns and involve larger, often manufacturing, firms, which operate in more concentrated markets. It is concluded that competition law needs to be disseminated more widely amongst business communities. This will require greater prominence for competition policy within business school syllabi and greater reference to business and management theory on the part of competition law agencies would assist the comprehension of business techniques such as branding.

Title: Exploitative Abuse in Article 82EC: Back to Basics?

Abstract: For the last few years, the EC Commission has been reviewing its application of Article 82EC which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position on the Common Market. The review has resulted in a Communication from the EC Commission which for the first time sets out its enforcement priorities under Article 82EC. The review had been limited to the so-called ‘exclusionary’ abuses and excluded ‘exploitative’ abuses; the enforcement priorities of the EC Commission set out in the Guidance (2008) are also limited to ‘exclusionary’ abuses. This is, however, odd since the EC Commission expresses the objective of Article 82EC as enhancing consumer welfare: exploitative abuses can directly harm consumers unlike exclusionary abuses which can only indirectly harm consumers as the result of exclusion of competitors. This paper questions whether and under which circumstances exploitation can and/or should be found ‘abusive’. It argues that ‘exploitative’ abuse can and should be used as the test of anticompetitive effects on the market under an effects-based approach and thus conduct should only be found abusive if it is ‘exploitative’. Similarly, mere exploitation does not demonstrate harm to competition and without the latter, exploitation on its own should not be found abusive.

Abstract: This study examines the impacts of reforms – privatization, new entry and independent regulatory authority – on mobile network penetration and expansion using a new and hitherto unused panel dataset for 30 national mobile markets (i.e. 29 OECD countries and China) over the time period 1991-2006 under a 3-equation econometric framework. The estimation results confirm that introducing new entry is, in general, positively correlated with mobile network penetration and expansion; and in particular, the third entry brings many more benefits than the second one. The results also highlight the crucial role of an independent regulator in privatized mobile markets. Especially, the dynamic estimation results suggest that without an independent regulator, privatization is, on average, negatively correlated with mobile network expansion, even in certain competitive market environments.

Title: ‘Consumer’ versus ‘Customer’: the Devil in the Detail

Abstract: The ultimate objective of EC competition rules is arguably the enhancement of ‘consumer welfare’. In EC competition law, however, ‘consumer’ merely means ‘customer’. Not being limited to final consumers, the concept also encompasses intermediate customers. Moreover, according to the EC Commission, under Article 82EC, harm to intermediate customers is generally presumed to create harm to consumers and where intermediate customers are not competitors of the dominant undertaking, there is no requisite to assess the effects of conduct on users further downstream. This paper questions the appropriateness of this presumption in light of recent advances in economics, specifically that of vertical restraints and in particular non-linear pricing. It uses this literature to show that there are many instances where an increase (decrease) in ‘customer welfare’ does not cause an increase (decrease) in ‘consumer welfare’. In these cases, the presumption is devoid of economic justification and likely to lead to decisional errors. The paper concludes that if the law is to serve the interests of ‘real’ consumers, the EC Commission should reconsider this presumption and its interpretation of the ‘consumer’ in ‘consumer welfare’. Until then, it remains questionable and objectionable whose interests EC competition law and in particular, Article 82EC, serve.

Abstract: We describe a first experiment on whether product complexity affects competition and consumers in retail markets. We are unable to detect a significant effect of product complexity on prices, except insofar as the demand elasticity for complex products is higher. However, there is qualified evidence that complex products have the potential to induce consumers to buy more than they would otherwise. In this sense, consumer exploitability in quantities cannot be ruled out. We also find evidence for shaping effects: consumers’ preferences are shaped by past experience with prices, and firms may in principle exploit this to sell more.

Abstract: It is conventional wisdom that collusion is more likely the fewer firms there are in a market and the more symmetric they are. This is often theoretically justified in terms of a repeated non-cooperative game. Although that model fits more easily with tacit than overt collusion, the impression sometimes given is that ‘one model fits all’. Moreover, the empirical literature offers few stylised facts on the most simple of questions – how few are few and how symmetric is symmetric? This paper attempts to fill this gap while also exploring the interface of tacit and overt collusion, albeit in an indirect way. First, it identifies the empirical model of tacit collusion that the European Commission appears to have employed in coordinated effects merger cases – apparently only fairly symmetric duopolies fit the bill. Second, it shows that, intriguingly, the same story emerges from the quite different experimental literature on tacit collusion. This offers a stark contrast with the findings for a sample of prosecuted cartels; on average, these involve six members (often more) and size asymmetries among members are often considerable. The indirect nature of this ‘evidence’ cautions against definitive conclusions; nevertheless, the contrast offers little comfort for those who believe that the same model does, more or less, fit all.

Abstract: I consider a Vickrey-Salop model of spatial product differentiation with quasi-linear utility functions and contrast two modes of production, the proprietary model where entrepreneurs sell software to the users, and the open source model where users participate in software development. I show that the OS model of production may be more efficient from the point of view of welfare than the proprietary model, but that an OS industry is vulnerable to entry by entrepreneurs while a proprietary industry can resist entry by OS projects. A mixed industry where OS and proprietary development methods coexist may exhibit large OS projects cohabiting with more specialized proprietary projects, and is more efficient than the proprietary model of production from the point of view of welfare.

Abstract: The health sector reform programme which began in Vietnam in 1989 in order to improve the efficiency of the health system has altered the way in which Vietnamese hospitals operate. The programme put the spotlight on input savings. This study aims to examine the relative efficiency of hospitals during the health reform process and assess – by looking at the relative efficiency of hospitals – the effects of the regulatory changes. The study employs the DEA two-stage approach referring to data from 101 general public hospitals over the period 1998-2006. The study revealed that there was evidence of improvement in the productivity of Vietnamese hospitals over the period 1998-2006, with a progress in total factor productivity of 1.4% per year. Furthermore, the differences in hospital efficiency can be attributed to both the regulatory changes and hospital-specific characteristics. The user fees and autonomy measures were found to increase technical efficiency. Provincial hospitals were revealed to be more technically efficient than their central counterparts and hospitals located in the North East, South East and Mekong River Delta regions performed better than hospitals from other regions.

Abstract: The combination of leniency programmes, high sanctions, complaints from customers and private actions for damages, has proven very successful at uncovering and punishing cartel agreements in the US. Countless jurisdictions are being encouraged to adopt these ‘conventional’ enforcement tools, in the absence of an international competition authority. The purpose of this paper is to widen the debate on cartel enforcement by identifying three issues which can undermine their effectiveness in some jurisdictions: (1) Corruption and organised crime; (2) Social norms that are sympathetic to collusive practices; (3) Collectivist business cultures built on personal relationships.

Abstract: Previous empirical assessments of the effectiveness of structural merger remedies have focused mainly on the subsequent viability of the divested assets. Here, we take a different approach by examining how competitive are the market structures which result from the divestments. We employ a tightly specified sample of markets in which the European Commission (EC) has imposed structural merger remedies. It has two key features: (i) it includes all mergers in which the EC appears to have seriously considered, simultaneously, the possibility of collective dominance, as well as single dominance; (ii) in a previous paper, for the same sample, we estimated a model which proved very successful in predicting the Commission’s merger decisions, in terms of the market shares of the leading firms. The former allows us to explore the choices between alternative theories of harm, and the latter provides a yardstick for evaluating whether markets are competitive or not – at least in the eyes of the Commission.

Abstract: Fighting collusion has long been a challenge in organizaions, whilst favoritism in organizations has long been attacked as one of the most important sources of workplace conflicts. This paper links the phenomena of collusion and favoritism together which seem to be irrelevant. We show that favoritism cannot benefit organizations where collusion is not a serious concern, meanwhile explicit favoritism can bring conflicts among collusive subordinates and undermine the efficiency of collusion, therefore it is effective in fighting collusion.

Abstract: Many retailers promise that they will not be undersold by rivals (price-matching guarantees) and extend their promise to include their own future prices (most-favoured-customer clauses). This is puzzling because the extant literature has shown that each promise independently has the potential to facilitate supracompetitive prices, and so one might think that the two promises are substitutes. In this paper, we consider why a firm might make both promises in the same guarantee, and show that price-matching guarantees and most-favoured-customer clauses complement each other and can lead to higher prices than either one could have facilitated by itself.

Title: ‘Consumer Welfare’ and Article 82EC: Practice and Rhetoric

Abstract: This paper questions whether the objective of Article 82EC is indeed enhancing ‘consumer welfare’ as suggested by the EC Commission when one examines the application of the provision thus far. It critically analyses the case law of the EC Commission and Courts to show that there is  great dissonance between the practice and the policy declarations on the provision. When one considers the practice alongside the rhetoric, Article 82EC appears as a provision enforced without a clear standard of harm leading to doubts about the legitimacy of enforcement. The article suggests that without a properly defined standard applied in actual decisions by the EC Commission and upheld by the EC Courts, the modernisation of Article 82EC cannot succeed.

Title: European Commission Opinions to National Courts in Antitrust Cases: Consistent Application and the Judicial-Administrative Relationship

Abstract: The House of Lords judgment in Inntrepreneur v Crehan, where the court did not consider itself bound by a finding of the European Commission, demonstrated the potentially contentious and constitutionally significant nature of the relationship between the European Commission and national judges in the field of antitrust. The decentralisation of enforcement of Articles 81 and 82EC arguably carries greater risks of divergent application of EC antitrust enforcement rules. While national competition authorities are linked through the European Competition Network, no such mechanism exists for national courts as this would offend against the principles of judicial independence and procedural autonomy. The Commission, as primary enforcer of competition law in the Community, has therefore attempted to complement the formal judicial 'dialogue' of the European Court of Justice's preliminary reference procedure with a strengthening of its own relations with the national courts. After addressing the broader theoretical context of administrative intervention in judicial decision-making, this paper examines the use of one tool to promote consistent application of EC antitrust rules - non-binding European Commission opinions and amicus curiae briefs to national courts in antitrust proceedings under Article 15 of the Modernisation Regulation. It identifies national cases where the Commission has actually intervened under Article 15 and assesses the nature and efficacy of this soft law mechanism. One finding is the difficulty in finding and tracing the cases, making the impact of the Commission’s advice difficult to judge. Transparency is desirable for legitimacy, legal certainty, and if Commission opinions are to have the most impact for promoting convergent application of EC antitrust rules among national judges.

Abstract: This paper examines one of the most important marketing strategies by software producers on the Internet. That is whether to offer free samples and if so, whether to list the samples on shareware repositories. I show that  rms with higher value products have a greater incentive to offer free samples but are more reluctant to do so if they are well known, and even when they do are less likely to be listed on shareware repositories. I then proceed to use four types of Probit-based models to corroborate the findings from the theoretical model.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of dynamic indefinite horizon R and D races with uncertainty and multiple prizes. The theoretical predictions are highly sensitive: small parameter changes determine whether technological competition is sustained, or converges into a market structure with an entrenched leadership and lower aggregate R and D. The subjects' strategies are far less sensitive. In most treatments, the R and D races tend to converge to entrenched leadership. Investment is highest when rivals are close. This stylized fact, and so the usefulness of neck-to-neck competition in general, is largely unrelated to rivalry concerns but can be explained using a quantal response extension of Markov perfection.

Abstract: This papers incorporates the economic theory of organizations into the framework of public law enforcement, and characterizes the dual-coalition structure of cartel organisation that allows us to highlight the strategic interactions between cartel participants under different antitrust policies. We show that delegation of authorities over collusive decisions from top executives to subordinates can mitigate the temptation of renege on collusive relationships and thus contributes to facilitating collusion. This result parallels the insights in Baker, Gibbons and Murphy (2002, 2006) which find that the optimal allocation of decision rights is to minimize the maximum temptation to renege on relational contracts. Moreover, the efficiency gains of delegation in facilitating collusion can be mitigated when the corporate leniency program is introduced, in particular whenever it is unlikely to detect cartels absent leniency and the corporate liability is much significant than individual liability.

Abstract: This paper examines Norwegian gasoline pump prices using daily station-specific observations from March 2003 to March 2006. Whereas studies that have analyzed similar price cycles in other countries find support for the Edgeworth cycle theory (Maskin and Tirole, 1988), we demonstrate that Norwegian gasoline price cycles involve a form of coordinated behavior. We also show that gasoline prices follow a fixed weekly pattern, with prices increasing significantly every Monday at noon, and that gasoline companies appear to use the recommended price as a coordination device with a fixed link between the retail and recommended prices. Moreover, the weekly pattern changed in April 2004; whereas Thursday had been the high-price day, Monday now became the high-price day. The price–cost margin also increased significantly after the weekly pattern changed in April 2004.

Title: The UK Cartel Offence: Lame Duck or Black Mamba?
Author-Name: Andreas Stephan

Abstract: A criminal offence requiring Ghosh dishonesty was introduced in the UK by the Enterprise Act 2002, primarily to enhance cartel deterrence as a complement to corporate fines. Yet the first convictions resulted from a US plea bargain in 2008. This paper identifies three obstacles to enhancing deterrence through the cartel offence. First, Norris v USA and a public survey suggest relatively weak perceptions of cartels persist in the UK. It was envisaged that convictions would remedy this, but prosecutors will continue to be very selective about the cases they bring to trial if there are doubts as to whether price fixing alone is viewed as objectively dishonest. Secondly, any increase in criminal enforcement risks discouraging leniency applications to the European Commission, because corporate immunity granted on the Community level does not automatically protect employees from criminal prosecution in national courts. There is also no conclusive mechanism for direct settlement, as there is in the US. Thirdly, sizeable benefits and purportedly low detection rates mean deterrence may be weak if custodial sentences do not become the norm. Further sanctions such as Director Disqualification Orders can play an important role in ensuring cartelists do not seek immediate reemployment at a high level.

Abstract: We develop a simple framework for analyzing the optimal design of leniency programs, which allow cartel members to denounce their collusive agreements. We highlight a basic trade-off between two opposite forces: leniency can destabiliza cartels, by encouraging firms to report and bring evidence to the antitrust authority, but it can also reduce the expected penalties that cartel members face. We characterize the optimal leniency rates, both before any investigation and once an investigation is opened, and show that these two leniency opportunities are particularly useful when random investigations are unfrequent and/or unlikely to succeed in the absence of self-reporting; we also compare the effectiveness of alternative rules for late informants and repeated offenders.

Abstract: This paper provides an assessment of EC merger policy from three perspectives. First, it places the evolution of merger policy alongside the evolution of economic ideas in relation to competition and industrial organisation. Second, it highlights recent developments in the practical economic appraisal of competition in four areas: unilateral (non-coordinated) effects, particularly the appropriate use of simulation techniques and the efficiency defence; coordinated effects (collective dominance), particularly the role of the Community Courts; non-horizontal effects, particularly the need for the new guidelines; and remedies, particularly weaknesses in current practice. Third, it develops a simple bargaining approach to merger policy evaluation to draw conclusions about the trend in overall effectiveness of EC merger policy since 1989.

Abstract: Event study analysis is a branch of econometrics which attempts to measure the effects of economic events on the value of firms by examining stock market data. Providing that share prices reflect the underlying economic values of assets, changes in equity values will properly capture expected changes in the economic profitability of the firm. This paper considers the effect on stock prices of announcements relevant to Competition Commission references, using established event study methodology.

Abstract: Competition Authorities are introducing new informational remedies to help consumers search and switch more actively. Using a specially commissioned data set, and unique direct estimates of the gains, search and switching time which consumers anticipate, we examine the determinants of consumer activity in eight markets. We find that expected costs (and to some extent gains) do influence consumers as a utility maximising model would predict; but that their role is small, and other factors, particularly experience of switching in other markets, are also influential. We conclude that consumers’ confidence in their own estimates is crucial in encouraging market activity.

Abstract: The New Regulatory Framework (NRF) for electronic communications was intended to usher in an era of harmonised regulation across the European Union leading to better choice, price and quality for European consumers. The European Commission has voiced its frustration at the fragmented nature of the implementation of the NRF. In this paper I examine whether the NRF has indeed been introduced in a fragmented manner and whether that fragmentation affects consumers, taking broadband penetration, which is regarded as desirable both socially and economically, as the measure of consumer outcome. I find that a causal relationship exists between public policy, prices of unbundled local loops, market concentration and adoption of broadband. Using a Lagged Dependent Variable model, I find that decreasing concentration in the market structure of broadband access technologies at retail level has a strong effect on the take-up of broadband, with the effect taking time to be fully realised. To enhance consumer adoption of broadband, therefore, policy makers in the EU should seek to improve the opportunity for broadband competition.

Abstract: After the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991, Slovenia became an independent state and entered into the transition period from a planned to a market economy. Slovenia’s relative prosperity has been a key factor in the country’s approach to reform, which has differed substantially from other Central and Eastern European countries. It has followed a gradualist approach to change, frequently postponing many key structural reforms (World Bank, 2006). After it had successfully completed the transition process, Slovenia became a new EU member state on 1 May 2004. Its political and economic system, legislation and institutional setting fully correspond to those in the EU. Today Slovenia is considered to be one of the most successful (ex-) transition countries from Central East and South East Europe. On 1 January 2007 Slovenia was the first among the new EU member states to join the EMU and introduce the euro as its official currency. The process of liberalisation of the Slovenian electricity market to a large extent resembles what other EU countries were witnessing. To comply with the EU legislation, namely the Electricity Directives (96/92/EC) and (2003/54/EC), Slovenia had to adopt the Energy Act (1999) and the amended Energy Act (2004). The Slovenian electricity market has been partially opened since 2001. From 1 July 2007, when households became eligible customers, the electricity market has fully opened.

Abstract: According to the Agreement on Stabilisation and Integration to European Union, Serbia is obliged to implement reforms in the power sector and its power policy must be in accordance with the European Union power policy. Power sector reforms in Serbia have been started, and certain results were achieved. But, the electric power infrastructure became technologically obsolete, and for its reconstruction significant investments and the active participation of the state are necessary. Operative efficiency is at very low level. Also, Serbia has not yet decided whether the Serbian Electric Power Industry will be privatised, and if it is privatised which model will be applied and when.

Abstract: Romania is a net exporter of electricity to the SE Europe region. Its performance of this role will increase in importance with a) the completion of another nuclear generator and b) improvement in capacity for international transmission. Romania has committed itself to an electricity restructuring plan that includes vertical separation, but plans remain uncertain regarding the horizontal restructuring of generation. Among the more important issues yet to be decided are a) how hydro capacity will be allocated – it has more than ¼ of capacity and enjoys low costs – and b) how many thermal generation enterprises will be created, and with what assets. With more than ½ of the thermal capacity accounted for by CHP plants and with a winter demand peak for the foreseeable future, there is a real danger of inflexibility and a lack of competitiveness in a liberalised wholesale electricity market.

Abstract: According to the recently announced decision of the Regulatory Agency for the Energy Sector, starting from 30 June 2007, Montenegrin households will pay and increased electricity price. The price of electricity for households with meters that have both off-peak and on-peak tariffs will be 6.28c€/kWh, while for those with only one tariff, the price of electricity will be 8.62c€/kWh. Such prices do not include value added tax which is an additional 17%, or 7.35c€/kWh and 10.1c€/kWh, respectively. Though other countries in the region do have block tariffs in place, the Montenegrin regulator decided not to go with such a solution since the intention is to reduce and finally dismiss any kind of cross-subsidies between different consumer groups. In addition, a block tariff is qualified as complicated for calculations. This significant price rise will impose a heavy burden on the poor households and it may adversely affect the environment. However, even though electricity tariffs are increased and it is expected will increase more, the Government of Montenegro did not come up with a proper safety net infrastructure for poor people; rather, ad hoc measures are taken. In an ex ante investigation of the welfare impact of this price increase on households in Montenegro, we show that the anticipated price increase will result in a very significant increase in households’ energy expenditures. Higher electricity prices could also significantly increase the proportion of households using fuelwood for space heating. The Government of Montenegro needs to combine the pricing reforms with a carefully evaluated set of measures that will mitigate the effect of these reforms on the poor and the environment. A simulation of alternative policy measures shows that non-linear electricity pricing schemes may be a successful way of protecting the poor due to the high level of correlation between electricity consumption and income level in Montenegro. Alternatively, the Government of Montenegro could consider reforming the current social assistance scheme to broaden the base of qualifying households and improve the program’s targeting of the poor, or it might evaluate the feasibility of innovative financing schemes with the participation of the private sector, the electric utility company, and an emphasis on improving energy efficiency in the residential sector. The analysis has been completed prior to the decision of the Regulatory Agency, but assumed price increase is a good approximation. In addition, the paper briefly introduces the current situation in the energy sector in Montenegro.

Abstract: The paper provides an overview of the electricity market reform in Greece which started in 2001 and is still developing slowly. This is related to the persisting dominance of the incumbent company and the specificities of the electricity sector of Greece, which is heavily dependent on indigenous lignite-firing generation, while being located in the periphery of the EU internal electricity and gas markets. Competition through enhancing electricity trade in the region is limited today, as the establishment of an internal market in South East Europe also progresses slowly. Development of competition through gas-firing generation by new entrants has been the priority adopted by State and Regulator’s policies. However, the gas supply market in Greece and in the region still lacks behind.

Abstract: The electric power system of the Republic of Bulgaria is part of the united system of mainland Europe (UCTE) composed of the electric power systems of 23 countries as well as parts of Denmark and Ukraine. Their annual electricity consumption reached 2,530 TWh at 2.5% average annual demand growth in the period 2003–2006 (following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to UCTE). Bulgaria and Romania are the largest electricity producers among the South East European countries. Bulgaria produced 45 billion kilowatt hours (Bkwh) of electricity in 2005. Bulgaria’s nuclear facility, Kozloduy NPP, has allowed the country to become one of the major energy exporters in Europe, with the Bulgarian national electric company, Natsionalna Elektricheska Kompania EAD (NEK), exporting 7.5 billion kilowatts (Bkw) of electricity in 2005. Kozlodoy produced more than 40% of Bulgaria’s electricity in 2005. Reactors No. 1 and No. 2 were decommissioned in December 2002, and Bulgaria’s melectricity export potential shrank after it shut down reactors No.3 and No.4 in the beginning of 2007 due to EU safety concerns. After the closure of those units, only reactors No.5 and No.6 remained operational, generating an electricity shortage for the country and forcing it to significantly reduce electricity exports. In April 2006, the Bulgarian economy and energy minister announced that the cost of direct losses to Bulgaria is estimated to reach over $2 billion with the closure of the two units (No. 3 and No. 4). Bulgaria received $688 million from the EU as compensation for the closures. In January 2005, Bulgaria officially announced plans to have its second nuclear plant, Belene, operational by 2011 to offset the loss of the two reactors at the Kozloduy facility. In November 2006 the preliminary agreement was signed with the Russian company Atomstroyexport for engineering, procurement, and commissioning of Belene Nuclear Power Plants, Units 1 and 2 – two 1,000MW light water reactors. Design and construction will be supervised by Parsons Europe Ltd, while Italian energy utility Enel plans to hold a majority stake in the 2,000MW nuclear power station. It is estimated to cost between $3-5 billion and will be built along the Danube. Bulgaria fully liberalised its electricity market in July 2007, adhering to EU standards. The Government had already privatised seven power distribution companies, selling them to the Czech Republic’s CEZ, Germany’s E.ON, and Austria’s EVN in 2005 for a total of $827 million. In 2006, Bulgaria’s Privatisation Agency (PA) signed a draft contract to sell the 1,260MW Varna power plant to Czech utility CEZ for $250 million, after Russian utility company UES withdrew its $689 million offer earlier in the year over regulatory and environmental issues. CEZ has also pledged to invest another $140 million in the power plant. Bulgaria has the lowest electricity prices (in absolute terms) in EU-27. Household electricity prices have risen 13.6% over the last three years and are about 49% below the European averages. Similarly, industrial user prices have risen by 12.5% over the last three years and remain about 39% lower than the European averages. Prices for industrial users are lower in absolute terms than for households.

Abstract: We examine the effect of current electricity market reform on residential consumers, using a sequence of hypothetical scenarios which are likely to be prompted by reform. These include raising tariffs to cost-reflective levels and introducing a standing charge to recover 10% of the revenue to mirror cost-reflective structures. For Albania and Bulgaria, where household expenditure surveys and electricity tariffs are available, we analyse the effects of each scenario according to expenditure decile and region. We compare these results to findings from a previous study of Turkey. The impact of reforms varies considerably, depending on how far current tariffs reflect the long run marginal costs of supply, but likely reform scenarios will adversely affect low income households more than others.

Abstract: The paper provides an overview of the generation of electricity in ten countries in South East Europe during 1995–2004. Using the latest available statistics the potential of the nascent integration of the electricity markets in South East Europe is explored. We conduct a cross-country analysis of electricity production based on different types of fuel used. The region has a low level of gasification combined with few nuclear power generation facilities, while some countries heavily rely on hydro electric generation. Differences in countries’ resource endowment and the possibility of intertemporaral substitution between electricity generated from various fuels could stimulate a regional trade in electricity. Such trade could displace a proportion of the required investment in the construction of generation facilities, as an alternative to nationally independent energy policies. Finally, we consider the environmental impact of electricity generation, and identify some of the key trade-offs between different policy objectives.

Abstract: This paper discusses the evidence on electricity reform and relates it to the current situation of the South East Europe (SEE) electricity market. We begin by discussing the main elements of the European Union (EU) electricity reform model. Then we go on to discuss emerging good practice in the regulation of national electricity markets in the EU. This is important because it reflects the key role placed on independent regulation of the electricity sector in the EU reform model. Next, we evaluate the empirical evidence on the success of the EU reform model in particular before discussing the success of electricity reforms more generally. This leads on to a discussion of the particular context of SEE electricity reform and what specific issues this raises. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of more general institutional context of SEE electricity reform. The paper suggests that it will be a substantial, but worthwhile, challenge to create a workable supra-national electricity market in the region.

Abstract: The Energy Community Treaty, signed in Athens in 2005, creates a legal framework for an integrated energy market between the European Union and nine South East European partners – Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and the United Nations Mission on behalf of Kosovo. This paper examines the challenges posed by the application of the EU model of energy regulation and the acquis communautaire, and the ability of States to meet those challenges. Given the recent historical context of the 1990s Balkans conflict and subsequent reconstruction efforts, a number of external countries and bodies have intervened in the region with aid and technical assistance programmes. However, the incentive of eventual EU membership affords the EU in particular a certain bargaining power through pre-accession instruments, and the Energy Community framework allows it to act as gatekeeper. This regulatory alignment, encouraging co-operation on technical issues, is expected to create spill-over effects in other sectors of reform. The paper considers whether the EU energy model is appropriate in South East Europe at this stage. It suggests that regulatory reform alone may not be sufficient – the domestic institutional framework is a significant factor. Analysis using the World Bank’s quality of governance indicators suggests that different groups of countries should approach reform differently according to institutional capacity, and a ‘one size fits all’ solution may not be appropriate. This may have implications for targeting technical assistance and capacity building measures.

Abstract: To date the experience of the incidence of private actions for damages in antitrust cases has differed markedly across jurisdictions. The procedural rules surrounding private litigation may account for some of these differences. This paper explores the effect of rules concerning contribution among multiple defendants who are joint and severally liable for cartel infringement. The no-contribution rule is shown to lead to higher levels of aggregate damages and more information revelation to the private plaintiff. However, the no-contribution rule also has the potential to neuter any public leniency programme, thereby possibly reducing the number of cartels detected.

Abstract: The rivalry between developers of open source and proprietary software encourages open source developers to court users and respond to their needs. If the open source developer wants to promote her own open source standard and solutions, she may choose liberal license terms such as those of the Berkeley Software Distribution as proprietary developers will then and it easier to adopt her standard in their products. If she wants to promote the use of open source software per se, she may use more restrictive license terms such as the General Public License to discourage proprietary appropriation of her effort. I show that open source software that comes late into a market will be less likely than more innovative open source software to be compatible with proprietary software, but is also more likely to be made more accessible to inexperienced users.

Abstract: Monopoly pricing is a textbook market failure that is taught in the first year of any economics course. The implied welfare loss (or ‘exploitative abuse’) justifies a whole range of competition policy towards cartels, mergers and regulated industries. Yet there is widespread hostility to prosecuting the same exploitative abuse in the textbook monopoly case (i.e. under Article 82EC)! This paper seeks to understand this paradox. I conclude that, while there are important problems with prosecuting Article 82 exploitation cases (because of problems relating to measurement, market dynamics, multi-sided markets and remedy issues), it is important to keep open the possibility of prosecution; for example, in the forthcoming Article 82 Guidelines.

Abstract: This paper analyses the raison d’être of the current initiative for the federal policy change in the US regarding the issues of passing-on defense and indirect purchaser standing in order to draw policy lessons for the EC in the light of the Commission’s Green Paper on private enforcement of Community competition law. The paper finds that transatlantic policy learning in the substantive sense does not seem plausible due to the dramatic difference between the American rationale regarding the goals of private enforcement and the European doctrine of direct effect. Nevertheless, the paper argues that the US experience contains important policy lessons regarding the risks brought forward by private enforcement under diverse standards in the lack of effective judicial cooperation mechanisms in a multilevel polity. After analysing the current positions of the Community and national laws from this perspective, the paper finds that there is substantial room for diversity amongst the national standards. In addition, although existing Community measures provide solid ground for judicial cooperation, those measures should be strengthened in order to avert the litigation chaos which forced a policy change in the US. Consequently, the paper suggests that the Commission gives substantial weight to the procedural aspects of private enforcement in its forthcoming White Paper which the Green Paper largely overlooked.

Author-Workplace-Name: School of Economics, University of East Anglia Abstract: Behavioural and industrial economists have argued that, because of cognitive limitations, consumers are liable to make sub-optimal choices in complex decision problems. Firms can exploit these limitations by introducing spurious complexity into tariff structures, weakening price competition. This paper models a countervailing force. Consumers’ choice problems are simplified if competing firms follow common conventions about tariff structures. Because such a ‘common standard’ promotes price competition, a firm’s use of it signals that its products offer value for money. If consumers recognize this effect, there can be a stable equilibrium in which firms use common standards and set competitive prices.

Abstract: The modernisation of EC antitrust rules timed to coincide with the 2004 enlargement of the European Union is widely recognised as an historic and revolutionary reform. According to the dominant view that has emerged in both law and political science, the change is to be explained in terms of the interest and ability of the European Commission to engineer a reform that, behind the guise of decentralisation to national authorities, has in practice extended its power and influence over the control of anti-competitive agreements. Drawing on original research, this paper contests the conventional wisdom and the image of the Commission as an imperialistic actor that underlines it. It argues that such a view dramatically overstates the Commission’s power and that a more sophisticated explanation is required. First, the Commission was motivated more by changes in the thinking within an epistemic community of competition practitioners and lawyers than by an impulse to expand its authority. Second, contrary to the monolithic conception of the Commission on which the dominant view depends, the Commission was internally differentiated and the development of its reform proposals the product of internal negotiation and conflict, rather than the expression of an inner drive to expansionism. Third, scrutiny reveals the Commission to be a constrained organisation, rather than a body able to re-write competition law autonomously.

Title: Different Rules for Different Owners: Does a Non-Competing Patentee have a Right to Exclude? A Study of PosteBay Cases

Abstract: Courts have traditionally granted injunctive relief ‘automatically’ upon finding infringement of valid patents on the basis that it is the essence of the patent right to exclude others. But the U.S. Supreme Court signalled a change in 2006 when they vacated the Federal Court’s order granting injunction against eBay for willfully infringing valid patents of MercExchange. The ruling comes at a time when the debate on what have pejoratively been called ‘patent trolls’ has taken centre stage. This paper examines the issues connected to patent trolls and analyses cases post-eBay to study the effect that eBay has had on patent infringement litigation. The analysis shows that the economic status of the patentee and the nature of the patent itself can adversely affect the exclusive rights granted by the patent. This is because non-competing patentees and a patent which covers only a small component of the overall product are less likely to obtain an injunctive relief. Denial of injunctive relief results in judicially-instituted compulsory licensing of patents which dramatically scales down the bargaining power of the patentee during licensing fee negotiations. Wrongly being adjudged a ‘troll’ can have dramatic effects on the incentive for investment and innovation. Consequently, the paper argues that acceptance of the concept of patent ‘troll’ is likely to result in more harm to innovation that otherwise.

Abstract: In this paper, a dominant supplier and competitive fringe supply goods to a common buyer who has private information about the state of demand. We give conditions under which market-share contracts are proﬁtable, and we show that, in some cases, the full-information outcome can be obtained (unlike in standard screening models, where the agent earns an information rent in the high state and demand is distorted in the low state). Our results also inform the antitrust debate on bundling, ﬁdelity rebates and all-units discounts. We provide a new motive for a dominant ﬁrm to bundle its own product with a competitively supplied product (with ambiguous consequences for welfare), and we show that market-share contracts, which are a subset of ﬁdelity rebates, are more proﬁtable than all-units discounts.

Abstract: To prevent possible abuse of market power, an antitrust agency can force merging ﬁrms to divest some of their assets. The divested assets can be sold via auction either to existing competitors or to a new entrant. Divesture of assets extends the range of parameters when a merger satisﬁes a consumer surplus standard and should be approved. If the agency takes a more active stance toward the selection of a purchaser of the assets (e.g. to exclude an incumbent from the auction), then it could lead to a favourable outcome for consumers and merging ﬁrms.

Abstract: Electronic marketplaces (e-marketplaces) allow networks of buyers and sellers to conduct business online and to exchange information more efficiently using Internet technology. Despite the benefits that e-marketplaces potentially afford firms, concerns have been raised that these markets may damage competition. This study considers the antitrust or competition legislation related to e-marketplaces and examines the possible competition concerns they raise. Potentially anticompetitive features of e-marketplaces are examined and guidance for firm conduct when creating or participating in an e-marketplace is offered.

Abstract: This study examines the frequency and form of deposit account interest rate change. Specifically, the question of whether deposit interest rate change is synchronised with other banks or staggered at periodic intervals is addressed. Overall, evidence consistent with individual banks changing deposit interest rates in a staggered manner is recorded. Further, larger banks are seen to change interest rates in a more synchronised manner than smaller banks. Lastly, when banks offer multiple deposit accounts, these products’ interest rates are generally changed simultaneously by individual banks. These findings extend the current understanding of deposit interest rate change, and indicate that UK deposit interest rate setting is relatively rigid.

Abstract: We consider a two-period model with two sellers and one buyer in which the efficient outcome calls for the buyer to purchase one unit from each seller in each period. We show that when the buyer's valuations between periods are linked by switching costs and at least one seller is financially constrained, there are plausible conditions under which exclusion arises as the unique equilibrium outcome (the buyer buys both units from the same seller). The exclusionary equilibria are supported by price-quantity offers in which the excluding seller offers its second unit at a price that is below its marginal cost of production. In some cases, the price of this second unit is negative. Our findings contribute to the literatures on exclusive dealing, bundling, and loyalty rebates/payments.

Abstract: The paper reports on results from a public survey on attitudes to collusion and cartel enforcement in Britain. Respondents demonstrate an understanding that price-fixing is harmful and should be punished. While there is strong support for high corporate fines and naming and shaming, only 1 in 10 Britons think individuals responsible should be imprisoned. Weak perceptions of the severity of price-fixing are confirmed by only 6 in 10 people considering such practices to be dishonest. Sex and age strongly influence attitudes. Education and newspaper readership have less of an effect, indicating poor information dissemination. Only 20% would report their employer’s involvement in price-fixing without guarantees of anonymity and/or a reward; 14% would not report at all for fear of consequences. Public opinion is divided as to whether leniency programmes are justifiable. Respondents consider public enforcement to be more important than compensating parties injured by cartels.

Author-Workplace-Name: School of Computing Science, University of East Anglia Abstract: The UK Government is committed to abolishing fuel poverty amongst vulnerable households by the year 2010 and in the general population by 2016, but definition and measurement of fuel poverty remains controversial. We define a new measure of subjective household experience and explore links between this measure and the official objective definition, using a unique data set and the Family Expenditure Survey. We identify the relation between the two measures; explore the characteristics of households in each group; and how each measure is related to other household factors.

Title: Price Transparency and Consumer Naivety in a Competitive Market

Abstract: Despite intense price competition firms obfuscate product information when it is relatively costless to reveal, contrary to neoclassical predictions. This paper considers whether firms can profitably conceal (part of) their prices for a homogeneous product when consumers differ in their ability to form expectations of market prices. The model shows that the ability to conceal prices but still attract naïve consumers dampens competition and allows prices to be set above marginal cost. This suggests that the European Commission was correct to pass regulations that require airlines to set prices inclusive of taxes, fees and charges, because alternative policies of educating a proportion of naïve consumers to become sophisticated or assisting consumers to search the market more effectively could increase prices in some situations.

Key findings of the work include the general efficiency enhancing influence of UK bank mergers and the limited effect of merger on retail interest rates. Furthermore, different banking products appear to be influenced differently by mergers. It is proposed that future assessments of bank competition and mergers require an accommodation of different types of bank customer.

Abstract: This paper analyses the potential effect of electricity reform on different households, using a series of potential scenarios for price changes, and consumption information from the 2003 Turkish Household Expenditure Survey. Turkey is emerging as a regional energy market, hub, and transit country between Europe and Asia, and has been reforming her energy sector in line with EU Energy Acquis since 2001. Introducing a cost reflective tariff is an essential component of Turkish electricity reform. Yet, this tariff structure might create real hardship for, and thus strong opposition from, some households, which might not be compensated through the rather underdeveloped Turkish social security system. Perhaps to avoid the possible political costs of this before the general election of November 2007, the Turkish Government disregarded the sector regulator EMRA’s insistence, and postponed pursuing such tariff for at least five years. Identifying these households, however, helps to anticipate opposition, and perhaps to mitigate it partially through compensation schemes. This might also facilitate Turkey’s integration with the Energy Community of South East Europe created in 2005. To explore the likely effect of tariff changes on various groups of households we apply six scenarios. Firstly, we analyse the likely impact of EMRA’s proposal of reflecting large regional variation in technical and non-technical losses. We also consider the effect of a potential efficiency saving from the proposed merger of distribution companies. Then, we explore the potential outcome of raising the currently low ratio of residential to industrial tariffs to OECD average. Furthermore, we study the effect of reducing the rather high level of taxes on households. Lastly, we examine the likely consequence of changing the present flat rate prices per kilowatt hour to a tariff which reflects more accurately the pattern of consumer-related and consumption-related costs.

Abstract: This paper estimates the implicit model, especially the roles of size asymmetries and ﬁrm numbers, used by the European Commission to identify mergers with coordinated eﬀects. This subset of cases oﬀers an opportunity to shed empirical light on the conditions where a Com-petition Authority believes tacit collusion is most likely to arise. We ﬁnd that, for the Commission, tacit collusion is a rare phenomenon, largely conﬁned to markets of two, more or less symmetric, players. This is consistent with recent experimental literature, but contrasts with the facts on ‘hard-core’ collusion in which ﬁrm numbers and asymmetries are often much larger.

Abstract: This paper suggests that the ability of consumers to choose accurately between alternative suppliers is substantially limited even in a relatively simple and transparent market. Across two independent datasets from the UK electricity market we find, on aggregate, that those consumers switching exclusively for price reasons appropriated between a quarter and a half of the maximum gains available. While such outcomes can be explained by high search costs, the observation that at least a fifth of the consumers actually reduced their surplus as a result of switching cannot. We consider and reject several alternative explanations to pure decision error.

Abstract: This paper investigates empirically whether owner motivations are consistent with neoclassical models of profit maximisation. Contrary to the neoclassical model, in some markets owners gain private benefits from supplying products with certain characteristics. To consider this issue, a full theoretical model that allows owners to consider not only profit, but also utility, in their choices of price, product quality, and the use of an owner-specific production method was developed. Information was gathered on owner motivations from the UK speciality food sector to test the propositions of the theoretical model. Evidence of systematic utility maximisation is found and utility maximising owners set higher profit maximising prices and produce a higher quality product. These findings have implications for the UK speciality food sector.

Abstract: This paper provides a first attempt to understand how outcomes are determined by the standard institutions of merger control. In particular, we focus on the internationally standard 2-phase investigation structure and remedy negotiations of the form practiced by the EC. We find that there are inherent biases in remedy outcomes, and identifiable circumstances where offers will be excessive and where they will be deficient. In particular, we find clear circumstances in which firms offer excessive remedies, which goes against a possible intuition that firms should expect to extract an information rent for possessing superior information about competition in the market.

Title:  Just Enough: Empowering Fixed-Line Telecommunications Consumers through a Quality of Service Information System
Author-Name: Patrick D. M. Barrow

Abstract: Information, it is said, is power, and the proliferation of web-based information systems (IS) has made the potential for empowerment by information available to an increasingly large user population. The empowerment of consumers through quality of service information is a key component of modern UK economic and competition policy in order to both resolve certain information asymmetries between traders and consumers and facilitate switching, i.e. the ability of consumers to switch suppliers of goods and services. Using a case study approach, this paper concentrates not on the intricacies, physical design or specific information content of the IS itself but on the regulatory approach taken by the UK telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, to provide it. It considers how the mechanisms set up to provide and audit appropriate, comparable and reliable information actually favour the interests of the traders rather than the consumers. The result is that those people at whom such information is undoubtedly aimed (consumers) and who need it to make rational choices in the market are actually disempowered, particularly those vulnerable groups who may have special information requirements. It concludes that if consumers are to be properly empowered by information in such systems, the regulator must do more to better protect the consumer interest and provide them with information they actually need and not the information that the traders are willing to provide.

Abstract: This paper explores and quantifies the link between marketing and rulings on competition or antitrust law made by UK competition or antitrust authorities. This examination is timely due to both the changing form and increasing severity of competition law in the UK and the strong associations identified between marketing and antitrust law in the US literature. Through a comprehensive examination of past UK competition rulings from 1950 to 2005, the frequency and content of the principal forms of uncompetitive behaviour during the last half century are recorded. A high proportion of competition law violations are associated with the marketing function. UK competition authorities have viewed specific marketing practices and, more generally, the direction, scope and scale of marketing activity to be causes for concern. We conclude that marketers need to develop a greater awareness of competition law and contribute more to the ongoing discussion as to the present and future form of competition policy.

Abstract: In this article we chart the development of competition and deregulation of the British retail energy markets, explaining the evolution of competitive constraints when consumers are introduced to supplier choice for the first time.  In the context of rising real energy prices for consumers, and continued market power on the part of incumbents, we address the question of whether the control of pricing practices through the ex post provisions of the general competition law is sufficient to protect consumers.  We also explore the issue of whether reliance solely on these provisions is desirable given the uncertainty which surrounds the application of the Chapter II prohibition (governing abuse of dominance), specifically in respect of price discrimination in final markets.  We conclude that the outcome of the liberalisation experiment in terms of delivering benefits for consumers is unclear.

Abstract: This paper discusses the role of State Attorneys General in the enforcement of the federal antitrust laws in the U.S.  It provides a substantial background on the doctrinal roots of the State Attorney General's power to enforce federal antitrust laws.  Then, it analyses the advantages of the state enforcement mechanism both in terms of providing redress to consumers and deterrence to undertakings.  Building upon this framework and the empirical data on state enforcement, the paper critically analyses the proposals of the Antitrust Modernization Commission on state enforcement.  It suggests that the State Attorneys General constitute a vital part of the federal antitrust scheme, and problems associated with their enforcement efforts are largely over-stated.  Even if there really is a danger of over-enforcement, the paper argues that the problem can be solved through less dramatic amendments.

Abstract: This paper questions whether discrimination between consumers by a dominant undertaking can and should constitute an abuse of a dominant position under Article 82EC.  By finding that it can, the paper challenges the traditional interpretation of the discrimination ban under that provision, namely that discrimination constitutes abuse only when directed against the intermediate customers of the dominant undertaking.  As such, the paper seeks to clarify the scope of Article 82EC as regards discrimination, and elaborate on whether discrimination between consumers should be abusive. This is done from both a law and an economics perspective, in order to put forward a proposal to ensure that competition law does not prohibit discrimination where economics finds it potentially welfare enhancing.

Abstract: This paper shows how separately itemised surcharges potentially facilitate collusion during a temporary cost if firms commit to their duration.  A duopoly model with price-matching punishments shows that if firms set higher prices they only receive punishment during the shock because they expect prices to fall in the future regardless of a deviation.  When it is likely that costs will fall in the future, the price-matching punishment is too small to increase prices, so firms maintain rigid prices.  When it is unlikely that costs will fall the punishment is harsh enough to sustain marginally higher supracompetitive prices.  However, if firms commit to surcharges for the shock's duration they are able to set even higher prices, because surcharges effectively commit firms to a price decrease and so threaten a harsher punishment after the cost shock has ended.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the Somerfield decision of the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT). In that decision, the CAT demonstrated a high degree of deference to the Competition Commission where the latter was scoping divestiture remedies in a merger case. This approach is consistent with the case law of the US and EC and, it is argued, is appropriate given the need for procedural expediency. The decision is placed in the wider context of the debates over the efficacy of merger remedies and the appropriate limits of judicial supervision of agency discretion in this area.

Abstract: This paper analyses the impact of the transition from price-cap regulation (deposit/loan rate control) to rate-of-return regulation (ROA, NPLs and/or BIS ratio) on banking industry structure. A simple theoretical model of banking competition suggests that the relative dominance of the two objective functions under different regulatory regimes affects the market structure. Imposing more stringent rate-of-return regulation, whilst relaxing price-cap regulation, reduces the equilibrium number of banks. The result from the theoretical model is also supported by empirical evidence from Korea, which has undergone substantial consolidation in recent years. The empirical analysis uses a unique data set of the entire commercial banking sector in Korea between 1976 and 2003, which covers both pre- and post- banking crisis periods.

Abstract: In applications as diverse as banking, supermarket and catalogue sales, it has been clearly identified that prices have a strong propensity to cluster around certain digits. This study forwards an explanation and empirical investigation of price clustering in retail markets, through an examination of how interest rates cluster in two UK financial services markets. It is proposed that price or interest rate clustering forms in retail markets as firms wish to maximise returns from customers who have difficulties in recalling and processing price information.  To compensate for limited recall, individuals use different behavioural strategies, such as rounding and truncating number information, which are recognised by firms when setting prices or interest rates. This theory is developed and tested using a dataset of retail interest rates from the UK which enables interest rate clustering to be viewed in both lending and investment markets, and at different levels of financial involvement.  It is found that interest rate clustering occurs in a manner consistent with firms maximising returns from customers who have less ability in recalling and processing number information. Further, the degree of interest rate clustering observed is exaggerated for investors of smaller monetary quantities, for firms which profit maximise and at higher market rates of interest.

Abstract: Turkish electricity reform is entering a new phase through the Turkish Government's proposal to create 21 new distribution companies, 18 of them through merger.  Two aspects of merger analysis are the operational cost savings and the potential production efficiency gains.  This paper concentrates on the second aspect and uses a recently developed methodology to assess the potential effect of these mergers and whether these mergers are efficiency enhancing.  This is performed by comparing the actual efficiency levels of observed distribution companies with the merger of proposed aggregated companies.  The model is calibrated on panel data from 1999 to 2003 which include measures of physical capital and labour inputs, as well as customer and energy related outputs.  The results indicate potential for considerable efficiency gains from the proposed mergers.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of dynamic indefinite horizon R and D races with uncertainty and multiple prizes. The theoretical predictions are highly sensitive: small parameter changes determine whether technological competition is sustained over time or converges into a market structure with an entrenched leadership and lower aggregate R and D research. The subjects' strategies are far less sensitive. In three out of four treatments (with the exception being a control treatment), the R and D races tend to converge to entrenched leadership. Investment is highest when rivals are close, and there is evidence of average over-investment.

Abstract: The past and current reluctance of firms and individuals to use private enforcement suggests that there are limited incentives for self-help. The key contribution of private enforcement to overall deterrence derives from cases which would not otherwise be brought, not simply because of resource constraints, but also because relevant information would not otherwise have come to light. In terms of revealing such private information, cases initiated and pursued by private litigants add much more to the equation than do cases merely following-on from decisions made by competition authorities. In this paper we use a simple model to highlight what features of the private enforcement system promote and hamper the use of these two different types of private enforcement. A key finding is that that to encourage new cases, it is essential that private enforcement is quicker than the time it takes to get a decision in a follow-on case.

Abstract: This paper develops a signalling model to look at some effects of the inclusion of an efficiency defence in merger regulation. By incorporating Type I and Type II errors into the antitrust agency's pay-off function approval probabilities are endogenized. The agency can choose to use a fuzzy approval rule (mixed strategies) after observing a double signal (produced evidence and the way it has been produced) as a tool to (partially) separate different merger types by changing approval probabilities and, consequently, firms' expected payoffs from a merger. The separation leads to a lower value of the expected mistake by the agency. If the agency can commit to certain policies, then a fuzzy approval rule is preferred under a wide range of parameters.

Abstract: This paper investigates competition between chain-stores and independents in the UK opticians' industry, using the relationship between the number of outlets present in a local market and the market size. Chain-stores are shown to have a significant effect on local market competition. In addition, the empirical approach is extended to allow inferences on the nature and extent of product differentiation. The results are broadly consistent with a model of vertical product differentiation in which chain-stores adopt national pricing strategies. The evidence suggests that the nature of competition between independent retailers depends on whether a chain-store is present.

Abstract: The 'two-thirds rule' stands as a caveat to the quantitative jurisdictional thresholds stipulated in the Merger Regulations. It prevents the attribution of a 'Community dimension' to large business mergers where two-thirds of the parties' respective turnovers are made in one and the same member state. It sees the relevant national authority and not the European Commission enjoy competence to assess the competitive effects of such a transaction. In the immediate aftermath of Gas Natural/Endesa - a case which the European Commission accepted only reluctantly did not possess a Community dimension - the Competition Commissioner mooted the legislative repeal of the two-thirds rule. The reception by member states of a proposal on these lines is unlikely to be uniformly generous. This note first reviews the origins and content of the two-thirds rule, before proceeding to consider the current momentum behind and prospects for successful reform. It suggests that a wider rapprochement between divergent perspectives on the best approach to achieving economic development both within and across the member states of the EC – and in particular on the problematic issue of support for 'national champions' – will likely be necessary before any revision can occur.

Abstract: Where fines are the only available sanction against cartels there is a trade-off between increased deterrence and the increased risk of insolvency. Higher fines are unacceptable to the European Commission because of the costs and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These concerns have led to the emergence of a 'financial constraints' discount which is applied with a lack of transparency and may be strongly influenced by the EC treaty objectives of protecting employment and social justice. Such bankruptcy discounts encourage infringing firms to paint as gloomy a picture of their financial situation as possible to reduce their cost of collusion. They also provoke cartel members into raising prices further, safe in the knowledge that they will never incur fines high enough to threaten their financial viability. The existence in the US of a parallel 'loose' bankruptcy discount allows international infringing firms to cite sanctions previously incurred in the US as grounds for 'financial constraints' in Europe. The effect is lower fines to the detriment of EC deterrence and international enforcement.

Abstract: This paper analyses the impact of various types of deregulation on banking industry structure. The empirical result is supported by evidence from Japan and Korea, which have undergone a substantial consolidation following a series of deregulation. The analysis is applied to a unique data set of the entire commercial banking sector in Japan and Korea, which covers both pre- and post- banking crisis periods. The paper also draws attention to the role of banking sector in the East Asian industrialisation, which influenced its idiosyncratic banking regulation and the evolution of the banking structure using the structure-performance relationship.

Abstract: This paper analyses the behaviour of banks' customers when a new technology (internet banking) is introduced. The determinants of consumer adoption of internet banking are characterised using survey data from Korea in both static and dynamic framework. There is evidence that adoption of internet banking is influenced by sex, age, marital status, degree of exposure to internet banking, and the characteristics of the banks. A duration analysis shows no evidence of first mover advantage (order effects) in internet banking whilst the largest bank (rank effects) in commercial banking remains dominant in internet banking. The results imply that the internet banking adoption is dominated by social norm effects.

Abstract: The structure of conglomerates embedded in the strong vertical ownership network in East Asia was believed to be a driving force for the economic success but was also blamed for the recent financial crisis in Asia given the fallacy – too big to collapse. This paper introduces a notion of collective relationship banking (CRB) as a mechanism for monitoring private information and investigates the likelihood of such banking relationship when the borrowing firms have heterogeneous vertical ownership structure using a Korean firm level panel dataset. Policy concerns are then addressed since the post-crisis corporate restructuring may create a more concentrated banking relationship with a few dominant banks.

Title: An Empirical Assessment of the 1996 Leniency Notice

Abstract: Although the 1996 'Notice on the non-imposition or reduction of fines in cartel cases' has been criticised by academics as lacking clarity and certainty, it has been described in European Commission literature as an 'indisputable success' and as having played an 'instrumental role' in uncovering and punishing secret cartels. This paper makes an empirical assessment of horizontal cartel cases in the EC opened as a result of leniency applications under the 1996 notice. Nearly three quarters of the cartels apparently uncovered by this notice were subject to equivalent prior or simultaneous investigations in the U.S. In addition, most of the cartels that were revealed operated in the Chemical industry, were all connected to each other by virtue of the same firms' involvement in more than one cartel, and all failed or ceased to operate before being revealed to the Commission by a cartel member. These two findings would suggest that the 1996 leniency notice was only of limited success in inducing firms to reveal cartels and that most applications for immunity were as a natural consequence of cartels failing and firms looking once more to their own interests rather than those of the cartel. The leniency notice largely succeeded in uncovering failed cartels, not active ones.

Abstract: Within a one-shot, duopoly game, we show that firms cannot use false instore price comparisons to deter rational consumers from further beneficial price search in an effort to create market power. However, by introducing a consumer protection authority that monitors price comparisons, we formalise Nelson's (1974) conjecture by showing that 'middle-order' monitoring can actually facilitate the deception of fully rational consumers, to deter them from otherwise optimal search. Despite this effect, we show that no increase in monitoring can ever harm consumers thanks to a second, larger effect that improves consumer information and increases the intensity of price competition.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the Most-Favoured-Customer (MFC) clause identified in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) Report on Foreign Package Holidays behaves not like an MFC but rather as if it was a variant of a so far unstudied price matching guarantee. This provides a clearer explanation than that by the MMC of why the guarantee is not in the public interest. The subsequent Court of Appeal decision focused attention on whether or not the MFC came with matching funding. It correctly identified that this made a difference, but was wrong in claiming that with matching funding the MFC would benefit consumers. As a result, the latest Foreign Package Holidays Order still does not provide the necessary prohibition of MFC clauses.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how a profitable, downstream merger can lower the merged entity's input price while raising that of its rivals, leading to an adverse effect on final consumers. This novel 'waterbed' result is surprising and very different to the unilateral and co-ordinated effects usually considered in the analysis of horizontal mergers. When demand is linear, all mergers involving a powerful buyer harm overall welfare even though the merger leads to marginal cost reductions that substantially increase output by the merged entity.

Abstract: Cointegration analysis has been used to assist the testing for price delineation in antitrust and merger cases as a way of deepening econometric evidence. This paper examines the impact of the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act (1999) instigated in 2001. By addressing the industry as a cointegrated system containing retail, wholesale and farm prices, short run and long run relationships were examined. Cointegration analysis between farm, wholesale and retail sectors suggests that the wholesale sector plays an important role within system. The econometric estimations find that long run wholesale pricing is weakly exogenous whilst farm and retail prices follow the same trend. This finding suggests that it may be as a result of market inefficiency and calls for further analysis of the role that the wholesale sector plays within the industry.

Abstract: This policy paper offers a synthesis of research on privatisation and its impacts on the utilities sector in different countries. It identifies issues to be considered by policy makers concerned with economic reform, including the implications of sequencing privatisation together with competition, regulation and industry restructuring; the role and importance of an independent regulatory agency; and the impact of introducing competition into utility markets. In addition to assessing reform through the more conventional method of examining productivity gains, it considers the distribution of the broader benefits from reform among key stakeholders –government, investors and consumers.

Abstract: Delineation of the relevant market forms a pivotal part of most antitrust cases. The standard approach is sequential. First the product market is delineated, then the geographical market is defined. Demand and supply substitution in both the product dimension and the geographical dimension will normally be stronger than substitution in either dimension. By ignoring this one might decide first to define products narrowly and then to define the geographical extent narrowly ignoring the possibility of a diagonal substitution. These reflections are important in the empirical delineation of product and geographical markets. Using a unique data set for prices of Norwegian and Scottish salmon, we propose a methodology for simultaneous market delineation and we demonstrate that compared to a sequential approach conclusions will be reversed.

Abstract: This paper analyses the strategic use of fixed costs to deter entry or monopolize a market in a standard Cournot framework. First of all a general case shows how the presence of fixed costs can affect the possible equilibria to the Cournot game. It is shown that the presence of a firm with a first-mover advantage can have important implications if fixed costs are raised. In addition the forward induction process becomes important in determining plausible equilibria. The use of firstly regulation and secondly 'nuisance' law-suits are considered as strategies to increase fixed costs.

Abstract:  This paper presents a model in which a firm attempts to gain market power by pricing above the competitive market price and simply trying to persuade illinformed consumers not to search for other lower priced firms. Fictitious price comparisons, or false sale signs could be used in this way to deceptively and profitably deter consumer search. A simplified model shows how this mechanism could exist when combined with moderately enforced consumer regulatory policy.
